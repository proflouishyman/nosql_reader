  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was a railroad worker for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. His career spanned various roles including foreman and brakeman, as well as trackman and possibly engineer, though there is some confusion with other employees named similarly in the records. Roenbaugh experienced several periods of disability due to illness, notably rheumatism affecting his left hip and an unspecified sickness that required extended leave from work. Despite these health challenges, he was able to return to duty multiple times after medical clearance by various examiners. The records suggest a career marked by periodic health issues but also resilience in maintaining employment with the railroad.",
