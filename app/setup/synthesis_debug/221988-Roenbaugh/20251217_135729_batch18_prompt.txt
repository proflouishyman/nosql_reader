DR. R. W. LOCHER
31 E. NORTH AVENUE
BALTIMORE

May 7, 1950.

Dr. E. V. Milholland,
B. & O. Building, ATT: Dr. Nance.
Baltimore, Maryland.

My dear Doctor:

I beg to acknowledge receipt of the letter you sent me in reference to Mr. Claude Roenbaugh from Lorain, Ohio. I also wish to thank you most kindly for sending him for examination at this time.

My opinion of Mr. Roenbaugh's original injury, was that he had some tearing of the muscle fibers of the muscles of the calf of the leg, just at the place where the tendo-achilles begins to form a fibrous tendon.

I feel that Mr. Roenbaugh ought to ultimately make a very excellent recovery if he follows certain definite activities which I have suggested to him. I feel that he has been favoring the leg entirely too much and it has not had a chance to develop as it should, in view of the long inactivity to which it has been subjected.

Again thanking you most kindly for referring him to me and with my kindest personal regards, I am

Sincerely y
... [truncated for length]

SUMMARY:
This is a letter dated May 7, 1950, from Dr. R. W. Locher to Dr. E. V. Milholland, regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Claude Roenbaugh, who suffered an injury involving tearing of the muscle fibers in his calf. Dr. Locher gives a positive prognosis for recovery with appropriate activity. The letter acknowledges referral, outlines the medical opinion, gives recovery guidance, and expresses gratitude. Several handwritten notes are present.
