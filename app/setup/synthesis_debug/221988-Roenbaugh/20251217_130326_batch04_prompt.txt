Dr. Wiener:

Notice has been received from the Railroad Retirement Board that Claude Rosenbaugh, Lorain, Ohio was granted an annuity, effective January 1, 1951. Under an Agreement executed by him, he is to refund to the Department all amounts advanced him after December 31, 1950.

From January 1, 1951 to February 19, 1951, he was paid for 92 days at $1.00 per day, or $92.00.

During this period $5.40 was deducted from such advances to cover full rate contributions.

If he desires to retain natural death membership the difference between the full rate contributions deducted, and the natural death contributions due 2.30 during the same period would be a credit of 3.00, leaving a net balance due the Department of $89.00.

Please contact Mr. Rosenbaugh promptly, and obtain his check, money-order, or cash for the amount due.

If natural death benefits are retained, the enclosed Form 165-A Spl. should be signed and returned promptly.

SUMMARY:
This is an agreement between Paul E. Crosley and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (Relief Department).

Upon Crosley’s death, repayments to the Relief Department take precedence over other benefit distributions.
