  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a local engineman in the Cond Train Division. His employment spanned several decades, during which he experienced multiple injuries that required medical attention and disability claims. In February 1918, Roenbaugh was reported sick and received benefits until April of the same year when he returned to duty. A significant injury occurred on January 10, 1929, where he strained his right leg while off-duty but on company property, leading to a period of disability that lasted between two to five weeks. Roenbaugh also experienced another strain in September 1929 and had a sprain in May 1929. Despite these setbacks, he continued working as an engineman until at least March 1935.",
