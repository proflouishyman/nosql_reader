  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the Akron Division. His career with the railroad involved several health-related absences and recoveries from injuries. In late December of 1929, he suffered a sore throat and cold that led to laryngitis, which kept him out of work for two to three weeks. Roenbaugh was also diagnosed with tonsillitis at some point in early 1930, though the exact date is unclear from the records. Additionally, he experienced a muscular strain in his right leg, an injury that occurred while off duty and led to further disability. Despite these setbacks, medical examinations indicated that Roenbaugh would eventually make a full recovery if he followed prescribed activities.",
