  "biographical_narrative": "Claud Roenbaugh was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working within the Wheeling Division's CT Department. His career with the railroad spanned several years during which he faced significant health challenges that led to multiple periods of disability. From June 1950 through January 1951, Roenbaugh experienced recurring bouts of sickness, each time leading to a period of total disablement and no wage allowance from his employer. These records suggest a prolonged struggle with Meniere's syndrome, as noted in a letter dated July 14, 1950, which advised that he should not return to duty until deemed safe by medical examiners.",
