  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various divisions of its Akron department during the early 1930s. His career with the railroad spanned several years, marked by multiple instances of disability due to sickness and injury. Roenbaugh's employment records indicate a series of disabilities from December 1929 through May 1930, suggesting he was often unable to work due to health issues. Despite these challenges, his continued presence in the company's records suggests that he remained an active employee with no significant disputes or terminations on record.",
