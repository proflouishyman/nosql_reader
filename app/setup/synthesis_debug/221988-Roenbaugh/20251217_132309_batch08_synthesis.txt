  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh began his career as a locomotive engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company around 1904. He was born and raised in Fort Washington, Ohio, where he experienced typical childhood illnesses before joining the Pennsylvania R.R. as a fireman for about thirteen years. Roenbaugh's tenure with B&O was marked by his dedication to both railroad work and union activities. In May 1947, he suffered an episode of vertigo and vomiting following strenuous gardening work, which led to temporary disability and medical examinations. Despite the incident, Roenbaugh returned to work briefly before being taken out of service again due to relapse concerns.",
