  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was an engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. He began his career with the company by September of 1946, working in the C.T. Department under the Wheeling Division. In September of that year, he suffered a disability due to a chronic infection affecting his left eye lid, which kept him from work until October 26th, 1946. Roenbaugh resumed duty on October 27th, but was later reported as disabled again in May 1947 with mild anxiety neurosis, indicating that he likely faced ongoing health challenges during his tenure at the railroad company.",
