  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman and later worked as an engineer. His employment spanned several divisions including Wheeling, Akron-Chicago, and Lorain stations. He was subject to regular medical examinations that confirmed he met the physical requirements for his roles. In late 1931, Roenbaugh suffered from bronchitis which led to a period of disability during which he did not receive wages. Despite this setback, he continued in service until at least February 1939 when he was transferred between divisions. His career with the railroad company reflects the typical challenges and transitions faced by workers during that era.",
