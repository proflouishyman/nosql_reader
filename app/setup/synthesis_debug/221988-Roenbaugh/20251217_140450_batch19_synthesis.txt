  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was an engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career began around 1917 when he worked as a fireman and later transitioned to an engineering role. Throughout his tenure, Roenbaugh served in various capacities including committeeman at conferences, which required him to be away from regular duties. In April of 1928, Roenbaugh took leave of absence for personal reasons but maintained his membership in the Relief Feature for natural death benefits. His career was marked by several medical issues, notably a diagnosis of popliteal cellulitis on February 29, 1937, which required rest and gradual use to recover fully.",
