Re: Relief Department matters - Engineer Claude Roenbaugh -

Wheeling, W.Va., Nov. 7th, 1946.  B-1
File R-27

Mr. W. L. Kennedy:-

Referring to your letter of November 6th, file ILB-221988-CT-Whg., in connection with disablement of Claude Roenbaugh, Engineer, who was disabled Sept. 25th, to October 26th, 1946 and this office certifying this information on Form 11.

The last paragraph of your letter stated that Form 5, gives the last days wages allowed as September 25th, at 1-05 P.M. We have checked our records and Mr. Roenbaugh was not allowed any wages on Sept. 25th, however, it develops that he was called at Holloway at 10-30 P.M. on Sept. 24th, and relieved at Lorain at 1-05 P.M. Sept. 25th, and as forms 11 are certified to from our time sheets we had no way of knowing that he worked on Sept. 25th, until the time card was checked. 

R. T. Brooks.

SUMMARY:
This is a correspondence concerning the disablement and wage certification for Engineer Claude Roenbaugh. The letter is a response to an inquiry about Roenbaugh's last day of allowed wages. It clarifies that, while initially it seemed he was not allowed wages for September 25th, time records showed he worked from the night of September 24th to the afternoon of September 25th. The information has been certified by the office.

Mr. E. T. Brooks,
Division Accountant,
Wheeling, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

We have received Form 11 prepared by Dr. Sayler to show Claude Roenbaugh, Engineer, totally disabled from September 25th to October 26th, 1946, on which you certified no wages were allowed for that period.

However, Form 5 gives the last day wages were allowed as September 25th at 1:05 PM. It will be appreciated if you will again check your records and advise whether or not wages were allowed Mr. Roenbaugh for any part of that day.

Very respectfully,

Superintendent Relief Department.

cy- Dr. Sayler.

SUMMARY:
A letter from the Superintendent Relief Department in Baltimore on November 6, 1946, addressed to Mr. E. T. Brooks, Division Accountant, Wheeling, W. Va. The letter concerns Claude Roenbaugh, an engineer certified as totally disabled from September 25 to October 26, 1946. It seeks clarification on whether wages were allowed for Roenbaugh, specifically for part of September 25, 1946, as there appears to be a discrepancy between Form 11 and Form 5 regarding wage allowances.
