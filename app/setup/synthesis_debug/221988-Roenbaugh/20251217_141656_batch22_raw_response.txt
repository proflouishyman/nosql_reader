  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) from at least as early as September 1929. He held positions including Fireman and Engineman within the C.T. Department, primarily in the Akron Division. His career with B&O was marked by several periods of disablement due to sickness or injury between June 1929 and November 1931. Roenbaugh's medical records indicate he suffered from a strained leg and general colds, which led to multiple absences from work. Despite these interruptions, there is no indication that his employment was terminated, suggesting he returned to active duty after each period of disablement.",
