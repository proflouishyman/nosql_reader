  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was a fireman and later an engineman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career spanned several decades, with records indicating his employment from at least the late 1920s into the early 1930s. Roenbaugh faced significant health challenges during his tenure, including multiple instances of injury or illness that required medical attention and temporary disability leave. In January 1927, he was reported disabled due to sickness, and again in January 1937 when he suffered from cellulitis affecting his left leg. Despite these setbacks, Roenbaugh's records suggest a determination to return to work after recovery periods. His career with the railroad appears to have been marked by both loyalty and resilience in overcoming health obstacles.",
