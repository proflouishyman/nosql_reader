  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was an engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. His career with the railroad appears to have been marked by health issues, particularly Meniere's Syndrome, which led him to apply for relief benefits starting from June 3, 1950. In January of 1951, he applied for an annuity through the Railroad Retirement Board, and his application was processed in early February of that year. Roenbaugh had been receiving sickness benefits during this period but would be required to refund any overpayments once his annuity became effective on January 1, 1951. His case involved multiple communications between medical examiners and administrators regarding the correct date of birth and details about his application for an annuity.",
