His career spanned several decades, marked by various injuries sustained while on duty. Roenbaugh's first recorded injury occurred in May 1943 when he suffered a contused and punctured wound near his right eye after being thrown against a cab during an accident. He was also treated for lumbago in April 1944, which temporarily disabled him from work but did not prevent him from resuming duties on April 22, 1944. Roenbaugh's medical records indicate that he received regular physical examinations and treatment for various conditions, reflecting the railroad company's efforts to maintain employee health and safety.",
