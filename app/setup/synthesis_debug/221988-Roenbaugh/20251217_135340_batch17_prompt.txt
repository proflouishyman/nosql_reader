COPY

May 7, 1930.

Dr. E. V. Milholland,
B. & O. Building, ATT: Dr. Nance
Baltimore, Maryland.

My dear Doctor:

I beg to acknowledge receipt of the letter you sent me in reference to Mr. Claude Roenbaugh from Lorain, Ohio. I also wish to thank you most kindly for sending him for examination, at this time.

My opinion of Mr. Roenbaugh's original injury, was that he had some tearing of the muscle fibers of the muscles of the calf of the leg, just at the place where the tendo-achilles begins to form a fibrous tendon.

I feel that Mr. Roenbaugh ought to ultimately make a very excellent recovery if he follows certain definite activities which I have suggested to him. I feel that he has been favoring the leg entirely too much and it has not had a chance to develop as it should, in view of the long inactivity to which it has been subjected.

Again thanking you most kindly for referring him to us and with my kindest personal regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

R. W. Locher

SUMMARY:
The letter is a formal correspondence from Dr. R. W. Locher dated May 7, 1930, addressed to Dr. E. V. Milholland (with attention to Dr. Nance) regarding the examination and medical opinion of Mr. Claude Roenbaugh of Lorain, Ohio. Dr. Locher expresses gratitude for the referral and provides a prognosis of Mr. Roenbaugh's leg injury, stating that recovery is expected if prescribed activities are followed. He notes the injury as a muscle tear at the calf, advises against inactivity, and assures that recovery should be excellent with proper care.
