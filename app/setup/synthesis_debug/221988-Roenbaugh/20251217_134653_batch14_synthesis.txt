  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh, born in 1882, was an engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company with a career spanning over three decades by 1943. His employment records indicate that he worked under various divisions including Wheeling (Whg.) and was part of the C.T. department. In his later years, Roenbaugh experienced several health-related incidents, such as lumbago in early 1942 and a minor eye injury in July 1943. Despite these setbacks, he continued to work diligently for the railroad company until at least 1943.",
