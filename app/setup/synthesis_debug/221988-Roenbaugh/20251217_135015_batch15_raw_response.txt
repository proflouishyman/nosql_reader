  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh, an engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, began his career in 1941 as part of the Transportation Department on the Akron-Chicago Division at Lorain, Ohio Station. His employment records indicate a series of transfers between divisions within the company, including a move to the Wheeling Division in September 1941. Roenbaugh experienced health issues that led to periods of disability due to gastroenteritis in July and August 1941. Despite these setbacks, he was able to return to duty by mid-August. His career with the railroad company spanned several years until his death in 1950.",
