  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as an engineer and later served as an engineman in various divisions across Ohio. His employment spanned several decades, from at least 1903 to 1953, during which he experienced multiple medical examinations and a notable injury. In July 1923, Roenbaugh was reported disabled due to sickness, though no claim for compensation was filed. He also suffered an injury in December 1927, involving a 'hole in the leg,' as noted by a medical examiner. Roenbaugh's career included transfers between divisions, such as from Lorain to Wheeling in July 1953.",
