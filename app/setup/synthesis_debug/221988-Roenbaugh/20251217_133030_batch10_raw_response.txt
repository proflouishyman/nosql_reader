  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh was an engineer employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. His career spanned several years, during which he faced health challenges that affected his work. In August 1945, Roenbaugh reported feeling unwell due to low blood pressure and acute gastritis, leading to a period of disability from August 9th until September 18th, 1945. He resumed duty on the latter date but was later found to have a chronic infection in his left eye lid, which temporarily disabled him again in late September and early October 1946. Roenbaugh's health issues were closely monitored by the company’s medical department, including examinations by Dr. Sayler and others.",
