  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh, a locomotive engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O), began his career in 1904 after working as a fireman on the Pennsylvania R.R. for about twelve years. Throughout his tenure at B&O, he held various positions within the company's engineering department and was stationed primarily in Lorain, Ohio. Roenbaugh experienced several periods of disability due to sickness, including an episode in May 1947 when he suffered from vertigo and vomiting after working in his garden. Despite these health issues, he continued to work until at least July 1947, with medical examinations indicating that he was fit for duty under observation. Roenbaugh's career spanned several decades and included periods of illness and recovery, reflecting the challenges faced by railroad workers during this era.",
