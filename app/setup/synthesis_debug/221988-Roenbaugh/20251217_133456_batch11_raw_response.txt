  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Rosenbaugh was an engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career spanned several years during which he experienced multiple health issues that required medical attention and temporary disability leave. In May of 1945, he suffered from acute gastroenteritis and hypotension, leading to a period of disability. He also had a previous incident in August 1944 involving an axillary abscess, for which he received disability benefits until his return to duty on September 2, 1944. Rosenbaugh's records indicate that he was laid off on August 9, 1945, and reported sick on August 21, 1945, but returned to work in October of the same year after being treated for his ailments.",
