  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as an engineer and later a brakeman. His employment spanned from at least 1913 to 1916, during which he experienced multiple health issues that affected his work. In November 1913, Roenbaugh was temporarily disabled due to acute muscular rheumatism in his back, returning to duty by December of the same year. Another significant event occurred in February 1916 when he developed septicemia in his right arm after scratching himself while off-duty, which required medical attention and a period of disability before he could return to work on October 7, 1916. Roenbaugh's career with B&O Railroad was marked by these health challenges but also by his resilience and eventual recovery each time.",
