Cleveland, O.

March 8th, 1918.

Dear Sir:-

I am sending you herewith Form 15352, issued by Mr. P. C. Loux, reporting the detachment by absence, beginning Feb. 5th, of Engineman Claude Roenbaugh, and call your attention to the fact that this form was not forwarded to this office until the 6th of March. It would certainly appear that the form was not prepared on Feb. 5th, the date shown, but that it has been recently issued and dated back. I will thank you to investigate this delay and advise promptly, with return of enclosure.

Very respectfully,

Superintendent.

HGH:
Copy to Examiner McCarroll.
