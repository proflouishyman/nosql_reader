  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various capacities, including as a Clerk Fireman and later an Engineer. His employment spanned several decades, during which he experienced multiple transfers and changes in occupational roles. Roenbaugh faced significant health challenges, particularly a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis that led to periods of disability and medical leave. Despite these setbacks, he continued his service until at least the late 1940s when he was examined for fitness to return to duty after a period of illness.",
