  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in an unspecified capacity and was later promoted to the position of engineer by at least 1944. His employment spanned several decades, during which he faced significant health challenges that impacted his ability to work. In September 1945, Roenbaugh reported being disabled due to sickness or old age, marking a period where he received disability benefits from the company's Relief Department. By June 3, 1950, Roenbaugh was officially documented as having Meniere\u2019s Syndrome, which led to his permanent disablement and subsequent annuity payments. Throughout this time, Roenbaugh resided in Lorain, Ohio.",
