  "biographical_narrative": "Claude Roenbaugh, a locomotive engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O), had a career marked by multiple instances of disablement due to sickness and injury. He began his employment in April 1940 with the C.T. Department, Whg Division, but faced several interruptions to his service due to health issues. Roenbaugh was reported disabled on at least three occasions: from August 1-13, 1944, for an axillary abscess; from May 12, 1949, likely due to sickness or accident; and from April 1-16, 1944, also due to sickness. Each instance required medical examination and certification of disablement by the company's Relief Department. Despite these interruptions, Roenbaugh returned to duty each time, indicating a resilient career within the railroad industry.",
