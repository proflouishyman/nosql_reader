His application for membership in the Relief Feature, dated March 16, 1923, indicates he was employed at that time and sought additional benefits through the company's relief program. Applegate was from Morgantown, West Virginia, but his application process took place in Fairmont, suggesting a possible relocation or temporary assignment. His health status was noted as good with no significant medical conditions, though scars were mentioned during the medical examination. No major injuries or disputes are documented within these records.",
