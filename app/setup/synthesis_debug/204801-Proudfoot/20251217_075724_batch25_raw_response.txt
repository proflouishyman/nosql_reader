  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, working as an engineer in Cumberland, Maryland. His career with the railroad began at least by 1937, when he underwent a comprehensive medical examination that confirmed his physical fitness for service. On April 9, 1942, while on duty near Swanton, Maryland, Proudfoot suffered a workplace injury—a longitudinal fracture of the fifth metacarpal bone in his left hand—when his hand was caught between a coal gate and rake. He resumed work after approximately five to six weeks of recovery. The records also indicate that Proudfoot had some family ties within the railroad community, as evidenced by correspondence regarding documentation of his birth date from his family Bible.",
