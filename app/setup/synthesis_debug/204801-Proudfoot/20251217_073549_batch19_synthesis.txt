  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was a long-serving engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily out of Cumberland, Maryland. His career spanned several decades, with records indicating significant periods of disablement due to various injuries and illnesses. In June 1920, he suffered an eye injury while on duty in Cumberland, which required medical attention from Dr. Warder in Grafton, W.Va., and resulted in a period of disability until mid-June. Proudfoot was also reported as disabled by sickness in November 1914 for about one month due to a leg ulcer. In June 1926, he sustained an injury involving his body, right arm, and shoulder when the engine slipped and jerked, requiring treatment from Dr. Evans. His family situation is not detailed in the records, but it appears that he was married at least once during his career.",
