  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) during the early to mid-20th century. His career with B&O is marked by several periods of disability, primarily due to neurasthenia and bronchitis. The earliest documented period of disability occurred in June 1943 when he was unable to work for nearly two weeks due to bronchitis. Over the following years, Proudfoot experienced multiple episodes of illness that led to his temporary inability to perform his duties as an engineer. Despite these health challenges, he remained a dedicated employee and continued working with B&O until at least August 1946 when he was still under medical supervision for neurasthenia.",
