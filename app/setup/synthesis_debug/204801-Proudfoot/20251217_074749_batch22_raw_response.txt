  "biographical_narrative": "Otto H. Proudfoot, an engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, began his career in the early 20th century and was active through at least 1919. His employment records indicate several instances of illness and injury that required medical attention and compensation from the company's relief department. In December 1916, Proudfoot suffered a period of disability due to sickness, which lasted until January 5, 1917. He was again disabled by influenza in late 1918 and early 1919, receiving benefits for three days from January 2-5, 1919. His career also included an on-duty injury in February 1918, which required medical attention and a return-to-work certification. Proudfoot's records show his involvement with the company’s relief department, indicating that he was part of the railroad workforce during a period marked by significant health challenges such as the influenza pandemic.",
