  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early to mid-20th century. His career spanned several decades and included various positions within the company, including roles as a road hand and later as an engineer in the Cumberland Division of the CT Department. Proudfoot's employment record is marked by significant health issues, particularly his struggle with osteoporosis which led to lumbago and collapsed vertebrae in 1952-1953. Despite these challenges, he was able to return to duty after a period of medical leave and examination by company physicians. His case highlights the complexities of railroad labor management during this era, especially concerning employee health and disability benefits.",
