  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, serving in the CT department at Cumberland Division. His career was marked by significant health challenges following two major accidents that occurred off duty. On March 17, 1934, he suffered a transverse fracture of his eighth rib and a comminuted fracture of his left femur in an automobile accident near Cumberland, Maryland. This injury led to a prolonged period of disability during which he required medical treatment at Memorial Hospital. Unfortunately, on August 12, 1934, while still recovering from the initial injuries, Proudfoot fell and re-fractured his left femur at the site of the previous fracture, further complicating his recovery process. Despite these setbacks, by March 28, 1935, he was deemed fit to return to duty with a modified shoe for compensation due to shortening from his injuries.",
