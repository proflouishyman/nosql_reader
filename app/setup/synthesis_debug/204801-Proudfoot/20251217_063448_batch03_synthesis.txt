  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily out of Cumberland, Maryland. His career spanned several years during which he faced multiple health challenges that affected his work. In June 1943, he reported sick due to bronchitis and was unable to return to duty until mid-July of the same year. Proudfoot suffered another injury on December 2, 1945, when he sustained a contusion to his left great toe while working in Grafton, West Virginia. This incident led to a brief period of disability during which medical services were provided and claims processed through the company's Relief Department.",
