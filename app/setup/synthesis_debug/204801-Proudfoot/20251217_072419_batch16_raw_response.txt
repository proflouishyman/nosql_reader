His career records indicate multiple instances of sickness-related absences, which were managed through the company's Relief Department. Notably, he experienced periods of disability due to various health issues including typhoid fever and liver problems. Despite these challenges, Proudfoot continued his service as a fireman throughout the period documented in the records.",
