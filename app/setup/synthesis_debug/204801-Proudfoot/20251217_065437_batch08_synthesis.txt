  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. His career spanned several decades, during which he held various positions within the engineering department. The records indicate that he worked primarily out of Cumberland, Maryland, but also had assignments at Bond, Maryland. In November 1940, Proudfoot slipped on ice while oiling an engine and suffered a sprain to his left knee. He was able to return to duty shortly after receiving medical attention, which included X-ray examinations that ruled out bone or joint injuries. His employment record also includes a sick leave due to influenza in 1918. Despite these incidents, Proudfoot's career appears to have been relatively stable, with no significant disruptions noted.",
