His career spanned several decades from at least the early 1930s to the mid-1940s. He experienced multiple injuries during his tenure, including a sprain of his left knee on November 28, 1940, and another disabling incident involving gastritis in June 1944. Proudfoot's medical history is well-documented through various forms and reports that detail the nature of his disabilities, the treatments he received, and the compensation he was entitled to during periods of disablement.",
