Mr. Otto D. Proudfoot,
Freight Engineer,
c/o Mr. W. H. Foster,
Road Foreman of Engines,

Dear Sir:

This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 8, explaining why you gave an incorrect date of birth, and your certified affidavit made on August 8, 1939, listing the births as they appear in your family Bible, showing that you were born on November 15, 1884.

It is not the policy of the Department, however, to accept affidavits as sufficient proof upon which to change dates of births in the records of this Department, and before any change can be made, it will be necessary that you send us a photostatic copy of the page of births from the Bible, or the page itself, and we will have a copy made here returning the original record to you.

It will be appreciated if you will give this matter your prompt attention.

Very respectfully,
