  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily out of Cumberland, Maryland. His career with the railroad spanned several decades, and he held positions within the company's engineering department. In April 1942, Proudfoot suffered a significant injury to his left hand while on duty, which led to a period of disability and subsequent compensation from the Relief Department. The injury involved a fracture to the fifth metacarpal bone in his left hand, necessitating medical attention and time off work. Despite this setback, there is no evidence suggesting that Proudfoot's career was permanently derailed by this incident.",
