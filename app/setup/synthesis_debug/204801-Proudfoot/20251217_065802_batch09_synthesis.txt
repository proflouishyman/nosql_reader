  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early to mid-20th century. His career spanned several decades and included various periods of sickness that required medical examination and certification from the company's Relief Department. Notably, he experienced a period of disability due to influenza in 1918 and again for gastro-enteritis in 1947. These incidents highlight both his dedication to service despite health challenges and the railroad\u2019s structured approach to managing employee disabilities. Proudfoot worked primarily as an engineer, suggesting a significant role within the operations of the B&O Railroad.",
