  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. His career with the railroad began sometime before September 1907 when he suffered an injury on duty in Cumberland, Maryland. On September 16, 1907, while working at Conn. yard, Proudfoot's arm was scalded when a sprinkling hose came unconnected. This incident led to seven days of disability benefits and medical attention from Dr. Wailes. After his recovery, he returned to duty on September 25, 1907. In January 1929, at the age of 38, Proudfoot underwent a vision examination as part of his ongoing employment with the railroad.",
