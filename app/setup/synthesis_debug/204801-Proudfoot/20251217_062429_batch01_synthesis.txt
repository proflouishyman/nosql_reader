  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in the Cumberland Division within the C-T department. His career spanned several decades, with his earliest documented record dating back to September 3, 1941, where he underwent a comprehensive medical examination confirming his physical qualifications for employment as an engineer. Proudfoot faced significant health challenges starting from March 26, 1946, when he was diagnosed with neurasthenia, leading to a series of disability leaves and benefit payments. Despite these setbacks, he managed to return to duty on October 18, 1946. However, his career came to an abrupt end due to his untimely death in the same year.",
