  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) from at least the early 1930s until his retirement or departure around the mid-1940s. He had a history of advancing his age to secure employment, as evidenced in documents dated October 5, 1939. Proudfoot experienced several injuries during his career with B&O, including an incident involving a foreign body in his eye and another injury that resulted from being crushed on duty. Despite these incidents, he was found physically qualified for service through multiple medical examinations conducted between 1931 and 1935 by various doctors. His employment records indicate that he worked diligently but faced challenges such as injuries and the need to conform personal documents to family Bible records.",
