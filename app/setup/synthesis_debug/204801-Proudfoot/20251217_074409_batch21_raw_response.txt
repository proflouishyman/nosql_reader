  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was a fireman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily in the Cumberland Division. His career with the railroad spanned several years during which he experienced multiple periods of sickness and disability. In February 1916, Proudfoot took sick leave for four days due to an unspecified illness. He also suffered from sciatica affecting his right leg, documented in May 1916, which required medical attention and a two-week period of disablement. Proudfoot's health issues were significant enough to necessitate multiple certificates of disablement and medical examinations by the company’s relief department. Despite these challenges, he was able to return to work on several occasions, indicating his commitment to his position as a fireman.",
