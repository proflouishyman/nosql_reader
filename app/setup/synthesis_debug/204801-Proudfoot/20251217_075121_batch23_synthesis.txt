  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in the Cumberland Division of the CT Department. He experienced several periods of disability due to myalgia in both shoulders, which began on September 18, 1948. Despite these health issues, he continued his service with intermittent returns to duty and ongoing medical examinations. His employment record reflects a series of disablement certificates and payments from the company's Relief Department, indicating a history of illness that affected his work but did not terminate his career.",
