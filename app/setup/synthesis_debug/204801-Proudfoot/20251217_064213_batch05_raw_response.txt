  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in Cumberland, Maryland. His employment spanned several years during which he experienced both minor injuries and significant periods of illness that affected his work. In March 1944, he suffered a cinder injury to his left eye while working as an engineer in Grafton, West Virginia. This incident was relatively minor but highlighted the risks inherent in his position. More significantly, Proudfoot faced a period of disability from November 17, 1944, due to influenza, which lasted until December 1, 1944. During this time, he received disability payments and no wages were allowed for his absence. His employment records also indicate some administrative issues related to the restoration of death benefits, suggesting occasional bureaucratic challenges in managing his employee status.",
