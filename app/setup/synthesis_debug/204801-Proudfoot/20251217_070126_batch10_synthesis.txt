  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in early 1907 as a Fireman, progressing to an Engineer position by at least 1912. His tenure was marked by several health-related incidents and administrative actions. In March 1912, he faced dismissal due to an accident involving a helper engine but was subsequently reinstated after management review. Proudfoot experienced multiple episodes of disablement, including gastroenteritis in April 1947 that required hospitalization under Dr. C.E. Durrett's care. His career spanned several decades with the railroad, and he maintained his position until at least April 30, 1944, when a final notice of disablement was issued, likely preceding his death in May 1947.",
