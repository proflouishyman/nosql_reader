  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily in Cumberland, Maryland. His career spanned several decades, with records indicating his employment from at least the early 1920s to the early 1950s. Throughout his tenure, he faced multiple injuries on duty, including a foreign body entering his left eye on March 9, 1931, and another incident in 1951 where a cinder lodged in his eye during stormy weather. These incidents highlight the hazardous nature of his work as an engineer. Despite these setbacks, Proudfoot continued to serve with the railroad company until at least 1951.",
