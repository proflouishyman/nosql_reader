  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O). His career spanned several decades during which he faced various health challenges that impacted his work. He began working for B&O in the early 20th century, though the exact start date is not specified in the records. In December of 1945, Proudfoot suffered a contusion to his left great toe when an express handle dropped on his foot while he was on duty in Grafton, West Virginia. This injury temporarily sidelined him but did not prevent him from returning to work shortly thereafter. His medical history includes regular physical examinations and occasional reports of disability due to sickness or minor injuries. Proudfoot's career with B&O reflects the typical challenges faced by railroad workers during this era.",
