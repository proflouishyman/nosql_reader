  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in the Cumberland Division within the C-T department. His career spanned several decades, with his earliest documented record dating back to September 3, 1941, where he underwent a comprehensive medical examination confirming his physical qualifications for employment as an engineer. Proudfoot faced significant health challenges starting from March 26, 1946, when he was diagnosed with neurasthenia, leading to a series of disability leaves and benefit payments. Despite these setbacks, he managed to return to duty on October 18, 1946. However, his career came to an abrupt end due to his untimely death in the same year.",

The earliest documented period of disability occurred in June 1943 when he was unable to work for nearly two weeks due to bronchitis. Over the following years, Proudfoot experienced multiple episodes of illness that led to his temporary inability to perform his duties as an engineer. Despite these health challenges, he remained a dedicated employee and continued working with B&O until at least August 1946 when he was still under medical supervision for neurasthenia.",

His employment spanned several years during which he experienced both minor injuries and significant periods of illness that affected his work. In March 1944, he suffered a cinder injury to his left eye while working as an engineer in Grafton, West Virginia. This incident was relatively minor but highlighted the risks inherent in his position. More significantly, Proudfoot faced a period of disability from November 17, 1944, due to influenza, which lasted until December 1, 1944. During this time, he received disability payments and no wages were allowed for his absence. His employment records also indicate some administrative issues related to the restoration of death benefits, suggesting occasional bureaucratic challenges in managing his employee status.",

The records indicate that he worked primarily out of Cumberland, Maryland, but also had assignments at Bond, Maryland. In November 1940, Proudfoot slipped on ice while oiling an engine and suffered a sprain to his left knee. He was able to return to duty shortly after receiving medical attention, which included X-ray examinations that ruled out bone or joint injuries. His employment record also includes a sick leave due to influenza in 1918. Despite these incidents, Proudfoot's career appears to have been relatively stable, with no significant disruptions noted.",

In March 1912, he faced dismissal due to an accident involving a helper engine but was subsequently reinstated after management review. Proudfoot experienced multiple episodes of disablement, including gastroenteritis in April 1947 that required hospitalization under Dr. C.E. Durrett's care. His career spanned several decades with the railroad, and he maintained his position until at least April 30, 1944, when a final notice of disablement was issued, likely preceding his death in May 1947.",

His employment history is marked by several instances of disability due to accidents or sickness, which spanned from late 1934 into early 1935. The nature of these injuries included fractures to ribs and femurs, indicating significant physical strain associated with his role as an engineer. Proudfoot's records suggest he was a dedicated employee who faced considerable health challenges but continued to serve the company despite multiple periods of disability.",

In March 1934, he suffered a transverse fracture of the eighth rib and a comminuted fracture of the left femur due to an automobile accident while off duty. This injury led to multiple disablement certificates and wage suspensions throughout the year.

  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, serving in the CT department at Cumberland Division. His career was marked by significant health challenges following two major accidents that occurred off duty. On March 17, 1934, he suffered a transverse fracture of his eighth rib and a comminuted fracture of his left femur in an automobile accident near Cumberland, Maryland. This injury led to a prolonged period of disability during which he required medical treatment at Memorial Hospital. Unfortunately, on August 12, 1934, while still recovering from the initial injuries, Proudfoot fell and re-fractured his left femur at the site of the previous fracture, further complicating his recovery process. Despite these setbacks, by March 28, 1935, he was deemed fit to return to duty with a modified shoe for compensation due to shortening from his injuries.",

Proudfoot was also reported as disabled by sickness in November 1914 for about one month due to a leg ulcer. In June 1926, he sustained an injury involving his body, right arm, and shoulder when the engine slipped and jerked, requiring treatment from Dr. Evans. His family situation is not detailed in the records, but it appears that he was married at least once during his career.",

His employment records indicate several instances of illness and injury that required medical attention and compensation from the company's relief department. In December 1916, Proudfoot suffered a period of disability due to sickness, which lasted until January 5, 1917. He was again disabled by influenza in late 1918 and early 1919, receiving benefits for three days from January 2-5, 1919. His career also included an on-duty injury in February 1918, which required medical attention and a return-to-work certification. Proudfoot's records show his involvement with the company\u2019s relief department, indicating that he was part of the railroad workforce during a period marked by significant health challenges such as the influenza pandemic.",

Despite this setback, there is no evidence suggesting that Proudfoot's career was permanently derailed by this incident.",
