  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company during the early to mid-20th century. His career with the railroad spanned several years, during which he faced multiple health issues that required medical attention and disability leave. In August of 1944, Proudfoot suffered from gastritis, a condition that kept him out of work for nearly two weeks. He was also affected by influenza in November of the same year, indicating recurring health challenges. Despite these setbacks, his employment with the railroad continued, showcasing the resilience and dedication typical among railroad workers during this period.",
