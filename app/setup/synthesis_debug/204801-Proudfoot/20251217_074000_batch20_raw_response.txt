  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in Cumberland, Maryland. His career with the railroad spanned several years during which he experienced multiple periods of disablement due to accidents and illnesses. In October 1914, Proudfoot suffered a traumatic ulcer on his left lower leg after being struck by a switch stand while on duty. He was unable to work from October 10 to November 14, 1914. Another significant event occurred in May 1916 when he developed sciatica and was disabled until August of the same year. Proudfoot's medical records indicate that he received benefits during these periods of disablement, reflecting the company’s policy on employee health and safety. His career with the railroad also involved regular medical examinations to ensure his fitness for duty.",
