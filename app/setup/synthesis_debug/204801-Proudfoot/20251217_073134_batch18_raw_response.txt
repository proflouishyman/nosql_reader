  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) during the early 20th century. His employment began sometime before March 9, 1903, when he first reported an incident of disablement due to sickness or accident. Over his career, he experienced several periods of disability and returned to duty multiple times. In 1905, he resumed work after a period of disablement, and in 1920, he was listed as an engineer and sustained a minor injury that required medical attention but did not prevent him from returning to work shortly thereafter.",
