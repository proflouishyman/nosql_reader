  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company from at least 1904 until his last recorded injury in August 1932. His career spanned several decades and included periods of sickness and minor injuries, such as typhoid fever in 1904 and a contusion over his left chest in 1932. Proudfoot's employment history shows that he was based primarily in Cumberland, Maryland, with some work assignments in West Virginia. He experienced at least one period of disability due to sickness for which he received benefits, as well as an injury while working on the railroad. Despite these incidents, there is no evidence of significant disputes or terminations, suggesting a stable employment history.",
