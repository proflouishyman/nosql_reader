  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company around the early 20th century. His employment spanned several decades during which he held various positions within the company's divisions, including Engineer and Trackman. He was a member of the Relief Department, securing benefits for himself and his family in case of death or disability. Proudfoot experienced health issues that led to changes in his employment status and benefit applications. In 1953, due to medical reasons, he retired from active service and received closure on his disability benefits. His career with B&O Railroad was marked by a series of administrative adjustments and personal challenges.",
