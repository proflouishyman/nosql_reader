  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early to mid-20th century. His career spanned several decades and included various incidents of injury that impacted his ability to work. In February 1929, he suffered a fall from a tank car which resulted in fractures to both wrists; however, this incident was not followed up with a claim for benefits. Another notable event occurred on December 13, 1952, when Proudfoot became disabled due to spinal osteoporosis and the collapse of vertebrae. This disability led to his retirement from active service by February 24, 1953, after which he opted to retain natural death benefits.",
