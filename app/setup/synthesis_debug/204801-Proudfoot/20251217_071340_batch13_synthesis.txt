  "biographical_narrative": "Otto D. Proudfoot was a dedicated engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various departments from at least early 1934 until his return to duty in April 1935. His career with the railroad was marked by several significant injuries and periods of disability, which affected both his health and employment status. In March 1934, he suffered a transverse fracture of the eighth rib and a comminuted fracture of the left femur due to an automobile accident while off duty. This injury led to multiple disablement certificates and wage suspensions throughout the year. Proudfoot's ability to return to work was uncertain for much of this period, but by April 1935, he had been cleared to resume his duties as an engineer.",
