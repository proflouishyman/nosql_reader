  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily as a car repairman and tender repairman at various points during his career. He was initially employed in the Motive Power Department in Cumberland Division until he was dismissed on March 3, 1920. However, by July 28, 1920, Freeland had been re-employed, this time as a car repairer at the Steel Car Plant in Cumberland. His employment history is marked by periods of dismissal and subsequent re-employment, suggesting that his career with the railroad was not without challenges. In October 7, 1920, Freeland suffered an injury to his foot while on duty, which led to a period of disability and medical leave.",
