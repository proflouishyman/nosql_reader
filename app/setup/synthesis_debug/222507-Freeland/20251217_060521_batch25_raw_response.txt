  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company and served as a Mason Helper in Cumberland, West Virginia. His career began sometime before February 1935 when he signed up for membership in the Relief Feature of the company's Relief Department. He had been contributing to this feature since at least 1924, with contributions increasing from 1935 onwards due to a new rate plan. Freeland experienced an injury or illness that required medical attention and resulted in his reporting back to duty on November 23, 1903. His father, Philip G. Freeland, provided consent for Thomas's employment when he was younger, indicating that Thomas may have been under the age of majority at some point during his early career with the railroad.",
