  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was a carman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily in the Cumberland Division of West Virginia. His career with the railroad spanned several decades, marked by multiple instances of disability due to both illness and injury. Freeland's first recorded instance of disablement occurred on August 24, 1949, when he was diagnosed with a varicose ulcer on his right leg, which kept him from work until September 19, 1949. He returned to duty on September 26, 1949. Another significant event in Freeland's career occurred on March 18, 1950, when he was disabled by influenza, leading to a temporary suspension of his duties and subsequent medical examination. Throughout these periods, Freeland received disability benefits from the company as per their relief department policies.",
