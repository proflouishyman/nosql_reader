  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in a capacity that evolved from carman to laborer, eventually becoming a permanent employee on September 1st, 1934. His employment was marked by periods of furlough and reemployment, indicating the economic uncertainties of the early 20th century. Freeland's career also included financial transactions related to his employment benefits, including insurance payments and deductions for various services or dues. Despite these fluctuations in employment status, he maintained a consistent presence with the railroad company through multiple applications and renewals of membership in the Relief Department.",
