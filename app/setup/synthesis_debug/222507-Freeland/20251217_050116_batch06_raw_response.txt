  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was employed as a carman by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the Cumberland Division. His career with the railroad included several instances where he suffered from medical conditions that required extended periods of disability leave. In December 1946, Freeland underwent surgery for an inguinal hernia and subsequently developed complications such as phlebitis in both legs. He was off duty due to these health issues until June 1947 when his condition stabilized enough for him to return to work. His medical history also includes a varicose ulcer on his right leg, which led to another period of disability beginning in March 1944 and continuing into the late 1940s. Freeland's records indicate that he received regular compensation during these periods of disablement.",
