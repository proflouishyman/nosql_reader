  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working as an Engine Cleaner and later a Brakeman. His career with the railroad spans at least from 1902 to 1906, during which he experienced multiple injuries that required medical attention and disability benefits. In February 1904, Freeland suffered an ankle sprain while on duty, leading to a period of disability for ten days. He was later transferred within the company in August 1905 from one division to another. Another incident occurred in July 1906 when he reported stomach trouble, which led to his temporary disablement and subsequent medical examination.",
