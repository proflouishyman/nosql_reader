Dear Sir:

Thomas B. Freeland, Tonder Repairer, was discharged March 3, 1920 while a member of the Department at Class C-2, under certificate 222507.

In view of this man's former membership, it is suggested that he be furnished with Form 60 and sent before the Medical Examiner. Kindly advise when this has been done.

Very respectfully,

Superintendent Relief Department.

Copy to Dr. J. G. Selby,
Medical Examiner,
