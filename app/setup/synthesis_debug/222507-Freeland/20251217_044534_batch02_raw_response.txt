  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was a dedicated carman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, starting his career around 1920. His long tenure with the company spanned over three decades, during which he faced multiple health challenges that affected his work and required medical attention. In July 1950, Freeland suffered an injury on duty when he struck his leg against a wrench left on a tool box, resulting in bruising and cuts to his shin. This incident was part of several other health issues including recurrent ulcers affecting his right mid-leg and cerebral arteriosclerosis that led to periods of disability. Despite these setbacks, Freeland continued to work diligently until his contributions were reduced due to changes in the company's relief department rates.",
