He worked as a carman and brakeman, positions that required physical labor and were prone to injury. Throughout his career, Freeland experienced multiple injuries and periods of disability, including an incomplete right inguinal hernia which necessitated surgery on December 3, 1946. Despite these setbacks, he continued to work for the railroad until at least early 1989 when a death benefit was paid out.",
