Mr. Thomas B. Freeland
Wiley Ford, W. Va.

Dear Sir:
Effective October 1, 1958, your contribution rate was reduced from $4.80 to $3.72 per month. Our records indicate that you paid contributions for the period October 1 to November 30, 1958 at the old rate of $4.80. An overpayment of $2.16 exists in your account. Therefore, if you have not already done so, you may, when making next payment of contributions, take credit for the overpayment of $2.16.

This letter may be presented to the nearest Agent of the Company, or to the Treasurer, Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., Baltimore 1, Md., as authority to adjust your account as outlined above.

Thereafter, contributions should be at the new monthly rate of $3.72 payable in advance, it being your privilege to pay as many months in advance as desired.

Yours truly,

olp

SUMMARY:
This letter from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company informs Thomas B. Freeland that his monthly relief contribution rate was reduced effective October 1, 1958. He overpaid for two months ($2.16), which can be credited toward his next payment. Future contributions should be at the new rate of $3.72 per month. The letter serves as authority for account adjustment.
