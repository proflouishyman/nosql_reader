  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland began his career with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company as a car repairman in Cumberland, Maryland. In October 1920, he suffered an injury to his right foot when struck by a maul while on duty, resulting in a laceration that disabled him for several weeks. After this incident, Freeland continued working at the railroad company until he was furloughed in April 1932. He returned to work in November 1933 following a successful physical examination and was restored to his membership status with additional natural death benefits. Throughout his career, Freeland's employment was marked by periods of injury and medical evaluations, reflecting the challenging nature of railroad labor during this era.",
