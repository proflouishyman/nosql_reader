Another significant event in Freeland's career occurred on March 18, 1950, when he was disabled by influenza, leading to a temporary suspension of his duties and subsequent medical examination.

In December 1946, Freeland underwent surgery for an inguinal hernia and subsequently developed complications such as phlebitis in both legs. He was off duty due to these health issues until June 1947 when his condition stabilized enough for him to return to work. His medical history also includes a varicose ulcer on his right leg, which led to another period of disability beginning in March 1944 and continuing into the late 1940s. Freeland's records indicate that he received regular compensation during these periods of disablement.",

Freeland began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in an unspecified capacity around 1917, as evidenced by a medical examination report from that year. His employment records indicate he held positions such as Trackman and Tender Repairman. In 1919, Freeland was reported to be able to return to duty after a period of disablement due to acute bronchitis. However, his career faced several interruptions due to health issues, including an incident in April 1942 where he was totally disabled by sickness for ten days. Throughout the early 20th century, Freeland's employment with B&O Railroad involved various administrative and medical examinations that documented his fitness for duty and periods of disablement.",

His employment history is marked by periods of dismissal and subsequent re-employment, suggesting that his career with the railroad was not without challenges. In October 7, 1920, Freeland suffered an injury to his foot while on duty, which led to a period of disability and medical leave.",
