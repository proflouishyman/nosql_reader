His career spanned several years, with notable periods of sickness and disability that impacted his employment status. In late 1952, Freeland experienced significant health issues, including cerebral arteriosclerosis with vertigo, which led to multiple periods of total disability. Despite these challenges, he was able to return to work after medical clearance. His case highlights the importance of comprehensive medical support and relief programs for railroad employees during this period.",
