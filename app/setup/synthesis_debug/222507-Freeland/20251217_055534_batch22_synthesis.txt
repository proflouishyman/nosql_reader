  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in Cumberland, Maryland, where he worked from at least January 1906 until his disability and subsequent return to duty. His career with the railroad company is marked by several instances of injury or illness that required medical attention and temporary leave from work. In January 1906, Freeland suffered a sprained ankle while working, which led to a period of disability and benefit claims. He was later involved in another accident in November 1906, for which he received additional benefits. Despite these setbacks, Freeland continued his employment with the railroad company, indicating resilience and dedication to his work.",
