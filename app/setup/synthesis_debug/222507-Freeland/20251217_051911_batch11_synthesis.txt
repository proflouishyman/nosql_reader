  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company as a Carman in Cumberland, Maryland. His career spanned several years, marked by periods of furlough and disability due to health issues. In November 1936, he reported severe gastric ulcer symptoms that led to hospitalization and a period of disability until December 1936. Freeland returned to duty on January 4, 1937, but was subsequently placed on furlough in June 1937 due to his ongoing health concerns. Throughout this time, he maintained membership with the railroad's relief department for natural death benefits.",
