Freeland served as a carman for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) in the Cumberland Division of the MP Department from at least the early 1940s until his retirement around mid-20th century. His career was marked by significant health issues, particularly thrombophlebitis affecting both legs, which led to multiple periods of disability beginning in April 1954. Freeland's medical condition necessitated several examinations and treatments, with the prognosis indicating an indefinite duration for his recovery. Despite these challenges, he continued to contribute to the B&O Relief Department\u2019s annuity plan post-retirement.",
