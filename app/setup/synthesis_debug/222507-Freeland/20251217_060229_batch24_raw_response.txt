  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland served as a cleaner for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in Cumberland, Maryland during the early 20th century. His career was marked by several periods of disability due to illness and injury. In October 1903, he suffered from an unspecified condition that led to his disablement and subsequent receipt of sick benefits. Freeland's medical records indicate a further incident in October 1907 when he sustained injuries attributed to accidental snow-related incidents. Throughout these periods, the company provided him with financial support through its Relief Department, which managed claims for disability and sickness benefits.",
