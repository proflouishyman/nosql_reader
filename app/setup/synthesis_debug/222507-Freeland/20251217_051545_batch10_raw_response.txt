  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, serving for a period of thirteen years before being dismissed due to an accident involving engine 5097 and eight cars at Preston Mine Switch on February 8th, 1920. He was reinstated in a non-inspector role after showing remorse and learning from his mistake. Freeland's employment record also reflects that he resigned during the strike of June 15, 1916, returning to service in January 1917. His career included various positions such as Carman and Trucker within different divisions including Cumberland Division. He was furloughed multiple times, requiring him to manage his insurance contributions while not actively working.",
