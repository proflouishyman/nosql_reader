His career spanned several years from at least 1912 to 1932. Freeland experienced periods of disability due to sickness, which impacted his employment status and led to interactions with the company's Relief Department for benefits claims. He was furloughed in April 1932 but requested to retain membership for natural death benefits. His career also involved administrative adjustments such as refunds related to dues payments.",
