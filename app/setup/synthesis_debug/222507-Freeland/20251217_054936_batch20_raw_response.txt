He held positions as a brakeman and possibly a coach inspector, though his exact start date is not specified in the records provided. His career included at least two notable periods of disablement: one due to tonsillitis in February 1914 and another unspecified disability in January 1916. Freeland was cleared for duty on both occasions but had to undergo medical examinations and certification processes, which are well-documented in his personnel file.",
