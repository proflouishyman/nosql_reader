  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas Burton Freeland began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) as a car repairman and later transitioned to become a carman craft worker. His employment spanned several decades, from at least August 1902 until May 1928 when he applied for additional natural death benefits. Freeland's career was marked by his dedication to the railroad industry and his consistent efforts in securing financial security for himself and his family through membership in the Relief Feature of B&O\u2019s Relief Department. He lived in Wiley Ford, W. Va., and designated his wife Cora Myrtle Freeland as his beneficiary.",
