November 22, 1954

Mr. Thomas B. Freeland
Valley Post, W. Va.

Dear Mr. Freeland:

This has reference to our form letter of October 6, 1954. We now find that the amount that you will receive representing the monthly payable to you under the Baltimore and Ohio Annuity Plan will not be sufficient to cover your monthly contribution.

It will therefore be necessary that payment be made to an Agent of the Company or to the Treasurer, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. Your contributions were last paid to cover the month of September, 1954.

This letter will be your authority to immediately pay $4.80 to the Agent at Cumberland, Maryland or to the Treasurer, to cover contributions for October and November 1954. Future payments should be at the rate of $4.80 monthly in advance.

Sincerely


SUMMARY:
This letter, dated November 22, 1954, informs Thomas B. Freeland that his payments under the Baltimore and Ohio Annuity Plan are not enough to cover his monthly contribution. He is instructed to pay $4.80 for October and November 1954 and advised that future payments should be made at the same monthly rate in advance.
