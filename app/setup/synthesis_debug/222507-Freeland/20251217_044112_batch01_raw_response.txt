On August 9, 1950, he sustained a laceration on his right leg, which required him to be placed on relief duty. Freeland's case highlights the railroad company’s response to employee injuries, including medical examinations, disability benefits processing, and hospital bills management. Despite his injury, he was able to return to work shortly after treatment.",
