  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was a long-serving employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, primarily working as a Tender and later as a Carman in Cumberland, Maryland. His career spanned several decades from at least the early 1920s into the mid-1930s. Freeland experienced significant health challenges, including an influenza-related disability that affected his work in late 1918. He was required to undergo medical examinations multiple times throughout his career to maintain or restore his employment status and benefits. His records indicate periods of furlough and subsequent efforts to resume full membership in the railroad's employee classes.",
