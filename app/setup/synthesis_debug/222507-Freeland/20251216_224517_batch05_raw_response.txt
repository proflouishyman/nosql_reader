  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a carman in the Cumberland division around 1930. His employment was marked by several periods of disability due to medical conditions such as gastric ulcer, influenza, and cholecystitis. These disabilities often led to furloughs and temporary suspensions from work, but Freeland consistently sought to return to duty after recovery. Despite the challenges posed by his health issues, he remained with the company for over a decade, demonstrating loyalty and resilience in the face of significant medical setbacks.",
