THOMAS B. FREELAND

PRHLAS 228507 Mo.-Gu.

October 22nd, 1935.

Mr. Thomas B. Freeland,
    Camden,
        c/o Mr. J. M. Scott,
            Car Foreman,
                Cumberland, Md.

Dear Sir:

Answering your letter of October 14th, this is to advise that as you did not resume duty within one year from date of original furlough, it is necessary that you appear before Medical Examiner and pass physical inspection, before you may be restored to your former full rate membership in Class C-2,95.

It is, therefore, suggested that you get in touch with Medical Examiner as soon as possible for that purpose.

In the meantime, this will be your authority to deposit with Agent 75¢ to cover your Natural Death contribution for October, and to continue payments thereof monthly in advance until your full rate membership has been revived.

Very respectfully,

cy- Dr. Guidewhite.

SUMMARY:
The letter from October 22, 1935, is addressed to Thomas B. Freeland, regarding his lapse in duty and membership restoration procedures. Due to Freeland's failure to resume duty within a year, he is required to undergo a medical examination and pass a physical inspection before regaining his former membership status. The letter also details interim steps for maintaining benefits through monthly payments until full membership is restored.
