  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in an unspecified capacity around 1917, as evidenced by a medical examination report from that year. His employment records indicate he held positions such as Trackman and Tender Repairman. In 1919, Freeland was reported to be able to return to duty after a period of disablement due to acute bronchitis. However, his career faced several interruptions due to health issues, including an incident in April 1942 where he was totally disabled by sickness for ten days. Throughout the early 20th century, Freeland's employment with B&O Railroad involved various administrative and medical examinations that documented his fitness for duty and periods of disablement.",
