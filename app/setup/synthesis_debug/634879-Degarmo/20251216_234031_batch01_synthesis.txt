  "biographical_narrative": "Harry Degarmo began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 1920s. His roles included switchman and brakeman, primarily serving in the Ohio division. He experienced several periods of disability due to injuries, notably a contused eye that kept him off duty for over a month in late 1923. Degarmo's employment was marked by consistent contributions to his benefits plan, indicating steady service despite occasional health setbacks. His records show he lived in Chillicothe and later at 111 Monrose Ave.",
