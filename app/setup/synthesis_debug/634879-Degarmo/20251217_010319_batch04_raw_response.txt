  "biographical_narrative": "Harry Degarmo was a yard brakeman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. He began his career around 1920, working primarily out of Chillicothe, Ohio. Throughout his tenure, he faced several injuries that temporarily disabled him from work, including an ulcer in his left cornea and being hit by hot cinders from a locomotive engine. Degarmo's medical records indicate he was physically qualified for duty despite these incidents. His employment spanned multiple decades, with contributions to the company’s relief department paid monthly from 1934 to 1941.",
