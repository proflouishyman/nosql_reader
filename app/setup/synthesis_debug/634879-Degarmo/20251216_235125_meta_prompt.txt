His roles included switchman and brakeman, primarily serving in the Ohio division. He experienced several periods of disability due to injuries, notably a contused eye that kept him off duty for over a month in late 1923. Degarmo's employment was marked by consistent contributions to his benefits plan, indicating steady service despite occasional health setbacks. His records show he lived in Chillicothe and later at 111 Monrose Ave.",

Despite these setbacks, Degarmo returned to duty shortly after each injury. His career spanned several decades, during which he demonstrated resilience and dedication to the railroad industry.",
