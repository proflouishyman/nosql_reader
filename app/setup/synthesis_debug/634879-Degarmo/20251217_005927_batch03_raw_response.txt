He began his service as a brakeman and later transitioned to trackman and yard helper positions within the Ohio Division. His employment spanned over several years, marked by multiple injuries that required medical attention and temporary disability leave. Despite these setbacks, Degarmo continued working for the railroad until at least 1930 when he was recorded as being off duty due to an ulcer of the cornea.",
