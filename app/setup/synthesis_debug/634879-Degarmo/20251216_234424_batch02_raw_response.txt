  "biographical_narrative": "Harry Degarmo was a railroad worker with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. He held positions as both a switchman and brakeman within the company's Ohio division, working primarily out of Chillicothe, Ohio. His career was marked by several injuries, including a severe blow to his left eye that occurred on September 12, 1923, which required medical attention and resulted in temporary disability. Another notable injury took place on September 17, 1927, when he suffered a contused face, leading to another period of disability. These injuries highlight the physical risks associated with railroad work during this era. Degarmo's career also saw administrative events such as his application for natural death benefits after leaving service in May 1924.",
