  "biographical_narrative": "Harry Degarmo was a railroad worker employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early to mid-20th century. He began his career as a brakeman around 1920 and later served in various roles including switchman, yard helper, and foreman within the Ohio Division. His employment spanned several decades, marked by multiple injuries that required medical attention and temporary disability leave. Despite these setbacks, Degarmo continued working for the railroad until at least 1941 when he passed a physical examination declaring him physically qualified for duty.",
