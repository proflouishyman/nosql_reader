  "biographical_narrative": "Harry Degarmo was a railroad worker employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. He began his career as a brakeman and later transitioned to roles such as trackman and yard helper. Throughout his tenure with the company, he faced several workplace injuries that required medical attention and temporary disability leave. His first recorded injury occurred on September 17, 1921, when he was burnt while working in Ohio. In 1927, he suffered a severe contusion to his face and eye after an incident involving a distant signal lever at Frost, Ohio. Despite these setbacks, Degarmo returned to duty shortly after each injury. His career spanned several decades, during which he demonstrated resilience and dedication to the railroad industry.",
