  "biographical_narrative": "Harry Degarmo, born in 1888, served as a railroad worker for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) from at least the early 20th century. His career spanned various roles including switchman and yard helper within the Ohio division. He experienced significant health issues throughout his tenure, notably suffering from an eye contusion in September of 1923 that led to a period of disability. Degarmo's employment record also indicates periods when he was furloughed or suspended, suggesting some administrative disputes over payments and deductions. Despite these challenges, he remained with the company for several years, contributing monthly to his benefits.",
