  "biographical_narrative": "Harry Degarmo was a railroad worker employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. He began his career as a brakeman and later served as a switchman, working primarily in Chillicothe, Ohio. His employment spanned several years, marked by two significant injuries: one to his left eye in September 1923 and another facial contusion in September 1927. These incidents required medical attention and temporary disability claims. Degarmo's career also saw a transition from brakeman to yard foreman before he left the service on May 31, 1924, applying for natural death benefits through the company\u2019s Relief Department.",
