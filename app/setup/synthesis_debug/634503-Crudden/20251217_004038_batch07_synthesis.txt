His career was marked by at least one significant injury that occurred on July 27, 1917, while he was on duty as a tollman. This incident led to his disablement and subsequent medical attention. Crudden's employment history also includes another notable event in which he suffered from pains in the left leg, suspected to be osteomyelitis, beginning on July 27, 1921. Despite these setbacks, Crudden was able to return to work after receiving clearance from medical examiners.",
