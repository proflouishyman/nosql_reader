  "biographical_narrative": "George Aloysius Crudden began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a checker at Pier 28 in Philadelphia around April 1943. His position involved overseeing the loading and unloading of cargo, ensuring accuracy and compliance with company standards. Throughout his tenure, he experienced changes in contribution rates due to new regulations affecting employee benefits. In June 1953, Crudden requested the cancellation of his membership in a department related to these contributions, citing dissatisfaction with recent increases. Despite this, he maintained communication with the Relief Department regarding refunds and administrative matters until at least August 1953.",
