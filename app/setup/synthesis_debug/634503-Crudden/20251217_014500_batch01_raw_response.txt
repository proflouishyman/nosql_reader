His employment records indicate he held positions within the company and participated in its Relief Department, contributing monthly to a benefit plan that would provide for his family in case of disability or death. Crudden's career with the railroad spanned several decades, from at least 1925 through 1935, as evidenced by correspondence regarding contributions and changes to beneficiary designations. He lived primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and North Merchantville, New Jersey, and was married to Hazel M. Crudden. His records do not indicate any significant injuries or disputes during his tenure with the railroad.",
