  "biographical_narrative": "George A. Crudden was a checker at Pier 22R for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in Philadelphia. He resigned from his position effective April 8, 1922. Despite this resignation, he sought to retain membership and benefits through the company's Relief Department due to his desire to maintain natural death benefits. His efforts to remain a member involved executing waivers and making payments as required by the department\u2019s regulations. Throughout the early 1930s, Crudden continued to make annual insurance payments and managed relief claims for fuel costs. The records suggest that he was in good health at the time of his resignation and maintained an active engagement with the company's benefits system.",
