  "biographical_narrative": "George A. Crudden began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company around 1920 as evidenced by correspondence and membership applications. He held various positions within the company, including working in Philadelphia where he was known to have been employed as an Office Manager for Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company at one point. Throughout his tenure, Crudden maintained active membership in the Relief Department of the railroad's relief program, making regular contributions and undergoing medical examinations to ensure continued eligibility. He experienced lapses in payment which led to temporary suspensions from the Relief Feature but was reinstated after passing physical inspections. His family situation is somewhat documented; he had a wife named Hazel M. Crudden whom he designated as his beneficiary for insurance purposes. Crudden's career with the railroad spanned several decades, and despite some administrative issues, he remained committed to his role within the company.",
