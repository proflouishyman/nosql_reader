  "biographical_narrative": "George Aloysius Crudden was employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company from at least April 6, 1922, as a checker in the Transportation Sub department. His employment spanned various divisions including Philadelphia and Palmer Divisions. He experienced several health issues during his career, notably an injury to his femur in August 1921 that was initially suspected of developing into osteomyelitis but later showed improvement. Crudden also had periods where he was totally disabled due to sickness or accident, such as from July 27th to August 8th, 1921, and again on a short period in August 10-13, 1921. He eventually left the service but retained his membership for natural death benefits. Crudden was married to Hazel, who lived at 206 Witherspoon Ave., North Merchantsville, NJ.",
