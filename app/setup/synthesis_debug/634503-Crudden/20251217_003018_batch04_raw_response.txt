  "biographical_narrative": "George A. Crudden was a checker at Pier 22R for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company based in Philadelphia. His career spanned several decades from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, during which he faced various administrative and financial challenges related to his employment benefits. In April 1922, Crudden resigned from his position at Pier 22R but sought to retain membership in the company's Relief Department for natural death benefits. Despite missing a deadline for retaining these benefits, the company allowed him to restore his membership after he executed a waiver. Throughout his tenure and post-resignation period, Crudden maintained regular payments towards insurance and relief contributions, indicating a continued interest in securing financial support from the railroad’s benefit programs.",
