Philadelphia, Pa.

C. W. Pence, M.D.
24th & Chestnut Street,
Philadelphia, Pa.

Dear Doctor:

I am treating Mr George Crudden 1917 N Newkirk street, and find that he is suffering from a condition of the femur which looked as if he might be developing an osteomyelitis. I have had him pictured, and referred him to a friend who does orthopaedic work, and he advised to wait a short time to see if he would improve.

I am glad to report that the pain has subsided greatly, but I do not think he is able to stand on his leg all of the time as he says his duties require.

Very truly,
A.H. Clagett

SUMMARY:
This is a medical letter from Dr. A. H. Clagett to Dr. C. W. Pence dated August 1, 1921, concerning a patient, Mr. George Crudden. Dr. Clagett describes Mr. Crudden's femur condition suggestive of developing osteomyelitis, recounts his referral for orthopedic evaluation, and notes the pain improvement, but doubts the patient's ability to meet all standing duties.
