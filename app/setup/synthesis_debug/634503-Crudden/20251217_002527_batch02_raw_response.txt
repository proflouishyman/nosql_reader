  "biographical_narrative": "George A. Crudden was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, whose career spanned from at least 1922 to 1935. His employment records indicate periods where he received relief payments and underwent medical examinations for his membership in the company's Relief Department. In October 1922, he paid dues for a period of service, and again in July 1927, when he acknowledged an overdue payment due to a move. Crudden was reinstated into the Relief Department after passing a physical examination by Dr. Pence on July 26th, 1933. However, his membership lapsed later due to non-payment of contributions from January 31st, 1933, and he was advised to undergo another medical inspection for potential restoration.",
