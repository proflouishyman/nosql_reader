  "biographical_narrative": "George Aloysious Crudden began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company around April 6, 1922, as a checker. He served in various capacities within the company's relief department and was later promoted to an operator role. His employment history includes several instances of disablement due to health issues, particularly involving his femur. Crudden faced periods where he was unable to perform his duties fully, leading to temporary wage suspensions. In 1925, he updated his beneficiary designation for the Relief Department to include his wife Hazel as the primary recipient in case of his death. His career with the railroad company spanned several years until he left service, after which he retained membership for natural death benefits.",
