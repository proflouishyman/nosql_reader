To adjust your membership account to include the month of January, 1935, please forward an additional check or money-order for $0.30, drawn to the order of E. M. Devereux, Treasurer. Future monthly contributions for your membership, which are payable in advance, will be at the rate of $1.05.

Very respectfully,

W. M. Kennedy,
Superintendent

SUMMARY:
This is a letter from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company Relief Department, dated December 17, 1934, addressed to Mr. George A. Crudden. It informs him that, starting January 1, 1935, contribution rates for Relief Department membership will increase. The letter requests an additional payment to cover the shortfall for January, and outlines the new monthly rate.
