His membership spanned several years with periods of lapses due to missed contributions, as evidenced by his reinstatement in July 1933 after passing a physical examination conducted by Dr. Pence. He held various roles within the railroad, including an office manager position at Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company in Philadelphia. Crudden's records indicate he was required to maintain regular payments and undergo periodic medical examinations to retain his membership status.",
