Attention Mr. W. M. Kennedy, Superintendent

Dear Sir:

Thanks for your letter of June 14th - File No. HCS:LMD-634503 - and while it has always been customary for my paying the relief dues a year in advance up until 1933, circumstances prevented my doing so this year.

In the future you can rely on my dues being paid a full year in advance as was done previous to 1933.

Thank you for bringing the matter to my attention.

Very truly yours,

ONE-GALLON, FIVE-GALLON, AND ONE-QUART CANS
Hercules Steam-distilled Wood Turpentine is sold in cans in each of the above sizes. The one-gallon cans are packed ten in a case; the five-gallon size two to a case or one to a special shipping and pouring crate; the one-quart can is packed twenty to a case. The three sizes are a great convenience. Each can bears a written guarantee of purity and quality which protects both dealer and consumer.
THE THIRTY- AND FIFTY-GALLON DRUMS
Hercules Steam-distilled Wood Turpentine is shipped in large quantities in tank cars and in thirty-and fifty-gallon drums (illustrated above). The steel drum is a safe and convenient container which can be used to ship turpentine to dealers and master painters who require less than tank-car lots. Each drum is labeled with a printed guarantee, similar to that on all other packages containing Hercules turpentine.

SUMMARY:
This document describes packaging options for Hercules Steam-distilled Wood Turpentine, available in one-gallon, five-gallon, and one-quart cans, as well as thirty- and fifty-gallon steel drums.

Mr. George A. Crudden 6152 W. 7th Street Philadelphia 20, Pa. Dear Mr. Crudden: As requested in your letter of June 24, your membership in this Department has been cancelled effective as of June 30, 1953. Check in your favor for $15.75, refunding contributions you have paid in advance from July 1, 1953 to Jan. 31, 1954, is enclosed. It is regrettable that you feel you must cancel your membership because of the recent increase in contributions. While the Regulations of the Department provide that the fund from which benefits are to be paid will be formed by the contributions of members and income from investments, the members were asked to make up by increased contributions but 50% of the additional amount needed to assure full payment of the benefits promised in the Regulations. Without obligation to do so, the Company, which was already paying the operating expenses of the Department, has voluntarily agreed to make up the other 50%. No positive guarantee can be given that contribution

SUMMARY:
This letter is a notice to Mr. George A. Crudden confirming the cancellation of his membership in a department effective June 30, 1953, as he requested. The letter explains the enclosed refund check of $15.75, covering contributions paid in advance for the period July 1, 1953 to January 31, 1954. The reason for cancellation is likely the recent increase in member contributions. The letter also justifies the necessity of the increase, explains how the cost is shared between members and the company, and reassures that no further increases are foreseen in the near future.
