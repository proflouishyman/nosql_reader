  "biographical_narrative": "George A. Crudden was a long-term employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, with membership dating back to at least 1920. His employment records indicate that he faced financial difficulties in making contributions to the Relief Department after January 31, 1933, which led to lapses in his membership and required him to undergo a physical examination by Dr. C. J. Pence for restoration. Crudden's career was marked by periods of arrears in payments and correspondence regarding his employment status, including discussions about potential retirement based on satisfactory physical condition. His work with the railroad involved interactions with freight operations, as evidenced by his inquiries into shippers like Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company.",
