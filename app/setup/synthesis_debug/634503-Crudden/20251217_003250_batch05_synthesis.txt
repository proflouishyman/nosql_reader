  "biographical_narrative": "George Aloysius Crudden began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in April 1922 as a checker at Company F, Philadelphia Pier 28. Over three decades, he remained a dedicated employee of the railroad company, handling various administrative tasks and contributing to the Relief Department's fund. In 1953, Crudden requested the cancellation of his membership due to an increase in contributions, which was processed promptly with a refund issued for $15.75 covering the period from July 1, 1953, through January 31, 1954. His career spanned significant changes within the railroad industry and administrative practices, reflecting broader trends of labor organization and financial management in mid-20th century America.",
