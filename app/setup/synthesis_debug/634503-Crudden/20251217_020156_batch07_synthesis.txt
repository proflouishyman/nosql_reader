His employment record indicates he suffered from an injury on July 27, 1921, which resulted in pain in his left leg and was suspected to be osteomyelitis. This disability led to a period of medical leave until August 18, 1921, when Crudden was certified fit to return to duty by the company's Medical Examiner. Prior to this injury, there is limited information about his career progression within the railroad company.",
