OCR TEXT:
Mr. George A. Crudden 6152 W. 7th Street Philadelphia 20, Pa. Dear Mr. Crudden: As requested in your letter of June 24, your membership in this Department has been cancelled effective as of June 30, 1953. Check in your favor for $15.75, refunding contributions you have paid in advance from July 1, 1953 to Jan. 31, 1954, is enclosed. It is regrettable that you feel you must cancel your membership because of the recent increase in contributions. While the Regulations of the Department provide that the fund from which benefits are to be paid will be formed by the contributions of members and income from investments, the members were asked to make up by increased contributions but 50% of the additional amount needed to assure full payment of the benefits promised in the Regulations. Without obligation to do so, the Company, which was already paying the operating expenses of the Department, has voluntarily agreed to make up the other 50%. No positive guarantee can be given that contribution
... [truncated for length]

SUMMARY:
This letter is a notice to Mr. George A. Crudden confirming the cancellation of his membership in a department effective June 30, 1953, as he requested. The letter explains the enclosed refund check of $15.75, covering contributions paid in advance for the period July 1, 1953 to January 31, 1954. The reason for cancellation is likely the recent increase in member contributions. The letter also justifies the necessity of the increase, explains how the cost is shared between members and the company, and reassures that no further increases are foreseen in the near future.
