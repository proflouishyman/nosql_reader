In April 1922, Crudden resigned from his position at Pier 22R but sought to retain membership in the company's Relief Department for natural death benefits.

Throughout his tenure and post-resignation period, Crudden maintained regular payments towards insurance and relief contributions, indicating a continued interest in securing financial support from the railroad\u2019s benefit programs.",
