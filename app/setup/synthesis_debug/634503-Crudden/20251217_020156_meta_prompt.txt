In June 1933, Crudden faced a lapse due to non-payment of contributions after January 31st, 1933, leading to a temporary suspension from the Relief Department's benefits. To restore his membership, he was required to undergo a physical examination by Dr. C.J. Pence in Philadelphia. The documents suggest that Crudden was also involved with freight operations for the railroad, possibly handling shipments for local businesses like Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company.",

His efforts to remain a member involved executing waivers and making payments as required by the department\u2019s regulations. Throughout the early 1930s, Crudden continued to make annual insurance payments and managed relief claims for fuel costs. The records suggest that he was in good health at the time of his resignation and maintained an active engagement with the company's benefits system.",
