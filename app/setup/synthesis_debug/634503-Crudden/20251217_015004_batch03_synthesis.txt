  "biographical_narrative": "George A. Crudden was a long-serving member of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Relief Department since at least 1920. His career with the railroad appears to have been marked by occasional lapses in payment for his membership dues, which were critical for maintaining his status within the relief program. In June 1933, Crudden faced a lapse due to non-payment of contributions after January 31st, 1933, leading to a temporary suspension from the Relief Department's benefits. To restore his membership, he was required to undergo a physical examination by Dr. C.J. Pence in Philadelphia. The documents suggest that Crudden was also involved with freight operations for the railroad, possibly handling shipments for local businesses like Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company.",
