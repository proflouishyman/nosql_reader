Dear Sir:
The information furnished in your letter of June 20th, with regard to your failure to deposit contributions subsequent to January 31st, 1933, has been noted.
As indicated in our letter of June 14th, the Regulations of the Relief Department require that Natural Death contributions be deposited by the first day of the month for which they are to cover, and failure to comply causes membership to lapse.
Under the circumstances, however, your restoration to membership will be given further consideration if you will report to the office of Dr. C. J. Pence, Medical Examiner of this Department, 24th and Chestnut Sts., Philadelphia, to undergo physical inspection. Dr. Pence's office days are Tuesdays and Fridays from 9:00 to 11:00 A. M.
It is, therefore, suggested that you get in touch with Dr. Pence at the earliest possible moment, and upon receipt of his report in this o

SUMMARY:
This letter informs George A. Crudden that his failure to make required contributions after January 31, 1933, has been noted and resulted in a lapse of membership in a Relief Department program. However, restoration to membership is possible if he undergoes a physical examination by Dr. C. J. Pence. The letter provides instructions and office hours for Dr. Pence’s office and advises prompt action. There are handwritten notes indicating a file is awaiting reply until July 25, 1933.

Attention Mr. W. M. Kennedy, Superintendent

Dear Sir:

Thanks for your letter of June 14th - File No. HCS:LMD-634503 - and while it has always been customary for my paying the relief dues a year in advance up until 1933, circumstances prevented my doing so this year.

In the future you can rely on my dues being paid a full year in advance as was done previous to 1933.

Thank you for bringing the matter to my attention.

Very truly yours,
