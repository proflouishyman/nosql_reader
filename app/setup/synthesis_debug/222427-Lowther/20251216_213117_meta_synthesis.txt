  "biographical_narrative": "Ira E. Lowther began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a machinist shop laborer on January 1, 1909, and later served as a hostler at Parkersburg, West Virginia. His tenure was marked by several medical examinations and disputes over vision standards that affected his employment status. Lowther faced challenges due to defective eyesight in 1914, which led to temporary removal from service but he successfully appealed for reinstatement. In February 1911, he suffered an injury when a coal chute fell on his foot while at work, leading to a brief period of disability and wage allowance. His career with the railroad company was characterized by these medical issues and occasional reassignments due to health concerns.",
