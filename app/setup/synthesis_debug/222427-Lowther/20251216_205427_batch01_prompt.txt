File 311 - Re: Ira E. Lowther -
Parkersburg, W. Va., March 23, 1942.
Mr. H. W. Hinal:
Referring to HD Form 196, regarding Ira E. Lowther, the reason this man was reported "sick" instead of "injured" was due to fact he advised me while in Hospital that had been troubled and had been wearing suspension and that he had stooped over and when he started to raise up the pain struck him and he could not get up and for this reason was taken to Hospital.
If this is a reportable injury, will you please advise so can make proper report? Also, advise what you would term his injury, if reportable.
Thanks.
W. J. Hohr

SUMMARY:
This letter, dated March 23, 1942, from W. J. Hohr in Parkersburg, West Virginia, addresses an issue with a report regarding Ira E. Lowther. The letter explains that Lowther was initially reported as 'sick' instead of 'injured' because he experienced pain while wearing a suspension and could not get up after stooping, which led to his hospitalization. The author asks Mr. H. W. Hinal if this should be reported as an injury and requests advice on how to classify it.

Cert. No. 220427
Baltimore, Md. March 31st, 1942.

Dr., Mimli:-
We are in receipt of your Form 17, dated March 30th, 1942, reporting Ira L. Lowther, Fireknocker, as totally disabled and asking for a decision as to whether or not the case should be handled as one of sickness or accident.

In view of the fact that the pain struck him while he was on duty, at the time he was clearing a fire, and the fact Dr. Harris, Company's Surgeon, states he has a sprain of his right adductor muscle, I do not see how we can get out of handling it as an accident on duty, and we will so handle it, after you have secured through the proper source Form 790 and forwarded it to this office.

It concludes that since the injury occurred while on duty and was confirmed as a sprain by the company surgeon, it will be handled as an accident on duty, pending submission of Form 790.
