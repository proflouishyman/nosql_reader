  "biographical_narrative": "Edward L. Collins began his career with The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as an engineer around the turn of the century, working primarily in the Conducting Transportation Department and various divisions including Cadilla, Pittsburgh, and Connellsville. He was a dedicated employee who applied for membership in the Relief Feature multiple times to secure benefits for himself and his family. Collins experienced a significant injury on July 19, 1897, when he collided with another object while on duty, which led to his disablement and subsequent medical examination. Despite this setback, he continued to serve the railroad until at least October 4, 1946, when he applied for an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. Throughout his career, Collins maintained a strong commitment to the company's Relief Department, regularly updating his membership status and making contributions.",
