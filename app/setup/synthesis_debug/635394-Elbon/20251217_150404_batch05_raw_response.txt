He began his employment as early as 1927 and held positions such as Fireman and later Personnel. His tenure was marked by periods of disability due to illness, notably influenza in February 1927 and again in March 1937, during which he received medical attention and sick leave benefits from the company's Relief Department. Elbon’s records indicate a steady employment history with no significant disputes or resignations noted.",
