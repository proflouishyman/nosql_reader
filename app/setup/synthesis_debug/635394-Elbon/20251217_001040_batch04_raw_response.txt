  "biographical_narrative": "Leo V. Elbon began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in December of 1920 as a fireman and served until at least February 1940. His employment was interrupted by a furlough from July 8, 1927, which he returned from on February 19, 1940. Upon his return, Elbon faced medical scrutiny due to a faint systolic mitral murmur detected during examination, leading to his rejection for membership in the Relief Department and employment as an engineer. Despite this setback, Elbon was not removed from the seniority roster but marked 'Incapacitated for train service.' In 1941, he sought re-examination to determine fitness for duty, indicating a desire to return to active service.",
