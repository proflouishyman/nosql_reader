  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman. He was born on November 16, 1896 and served in various capacities within the Conducting Transportation Department, including roles in the Cumberland Division. In September 1961, he sustained an off-duty injury to his left knee resulting in an avulsion fracture of the intercondyloid spine of the tibia. Despite this setback, Elbon's medical records indicate a series of examinations and consultations that delayed his return to work until further healing was confirmed. His career with B&O spanned several decades, during which he also applied for full membership in the Relief Feature of the company\u2019s Relief Department.",
