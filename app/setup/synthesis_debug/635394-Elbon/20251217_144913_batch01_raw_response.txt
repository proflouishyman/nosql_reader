  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. He worked for the Cumberland Division of the CT Department and resided in Keyser, West Virginia. His career with B&O was interrupted by a significant off-duty accident on September 3, 1961, which resulted in lacerations to his nose and chin as well as an intercondylar fracture of his left tibia. This injury led to a period of disability from September 4, 1961, through November 20, 1961, during which he was not allowed wages. The medical examination process involved several doctors, including Dr. Robert W. McCoy Jr., who treated Elbon at the Potomac Valley Hospital in Keyser. Despite the severity of his injuries and an uncertain prognosis, Elbon eventually resumed duty on November 20, 1961.",
