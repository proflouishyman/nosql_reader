  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. He initially joined the company in 1920 and served as a fireman in the Cumberland Division of the Conducting Transportation Department. In 1941, he faced medical scrutiny after being rejected due to a faint systolic murmur detected during an examination in 1940. Despite this setback, Elbon was re-examined multiple times between February and June 1941, with his condition eventually deemed satisfactory for return to service. His career included periods of furlough and subsequent reinstatement attempts, highlighting the rigorous medical standards of railroad employment during that era.",
