  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon was an engineer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. He worked in the CT Department of the Cumberland Division and resided at 40 Sharpless Street in Keyser, West Virginia. His career was marked by a significant injury sustained off-duty on September 3, 1961, which resulted in lacerations to his nose and chin and an intercondylar fracture of his left tibia. This injury led to a period of disability that lasted from September 4, 1961, until November 20, 1961. During this time, Elbon was not allowed wages due to his inability to work. His recovery and return to duty were closely monitored by the company's medical examiners and relief department.",
