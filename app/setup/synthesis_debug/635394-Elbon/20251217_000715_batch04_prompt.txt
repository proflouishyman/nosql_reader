Mr. F. G. Hoskins:

Referring further to yours of March 26th and mine of March 28th, regarding the case of Fireman Leo V. Elbon, Cumberland Division, who was rejected for membership in the Relief Department and for employment.

It is not felt that we are justified in dropping a man's name from the seniority roster simply because his physical condition is such that he is unable to perform the duties required of men in train and engine service. It is therefore, suggested that this man's record be marked "Incapacitated for train service - Date", and that his name be continued on the roster.

SUMMARY:
This letter addresses the case of Fireman Leo V. Elbon, who was rejected for membership in the Relief Department and employment due to physical incapacity. The letter suggests keeping his name on the seniority roster and marking the record as 'Incapacitated for train service'.

Referring to your letter of March 26th, with regard to Fireman Leo V. Kiborn on the Cumberland Division, who was recalled to duty from furlough February 19th, 1940, being rejected by the Medical Examiner for membership in the Relief Department account of having a murmur in his heart, in connection with which Dr. Mulholland advises he does not consider it would be advisable to employ him as he would not be considered safe as an engineer.
It will therefore, be satisfactory to drop this man's name from the Fireman's Seniority Roster on account of physical disability.

Baltimore, Md. March 2nd, 1940.

Mr. F. G. Hoskins,
General Superintendent,
Baltimore, Md.

Dear Sir:-
    Replying to your note under date of February 29th regarding Fireman Leo V. Elbon, who was examined by our Medical Examiner in Cumberland on February 19th, when he was recalled from furlough of July 8th, 1927, would advise that Mr. Elbon was found to have a murmur in his heart and I do not consider it would be advisable to employ him because if he remains in the service he will eventually come up for promotion to the position of engineer, and the chances are that at that time he would not be considered safe as an engineer.

Very truly yours,

Medical & Surgical Director.
