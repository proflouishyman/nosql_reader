  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily on the Cumberland Division. His career spanned several decades and included periods of furlough and re-examination due to health concerns. In 1940, he faced rejection from service due to a faint systolic murmur detected by Dr. Baker during an examination. However, subsequent examinations in 1941 found him fit for duty after no heart murmurs were detected and his blood pressure was within normal range. Elbon's career also involved participation in the Relief Department of the railroad company, where he contributed monthly to secure benefits.",
