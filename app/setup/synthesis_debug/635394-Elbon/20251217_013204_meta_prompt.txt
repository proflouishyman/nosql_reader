His career was marked by a significant off-duty accident on September 3, 1961, which resulted in lacerations to his nose and chin as well as a fracture of the left tibia. This injury led to a period of disability during which Elbon did not receive wages from October 20 through November 19, 1961. Despite initial uncertainty about his prognosis due to complications with treatment and medical opinions, he was eventually able to return to work on November 20, 1961.",
