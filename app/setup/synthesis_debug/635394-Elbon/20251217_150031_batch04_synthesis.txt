  "biographical_narrative": "Leo V. Elbon began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman by December 1st, 1920. His employment was marked by periods of furlough and medical examinations due to a heart condition. In February 1940, after returning from a long furlough starting July 8th, 1927, Elbon underwent a re-examination that revealed a faint systolic mitral murmur, leading to his rejection for membership in the Relief Department and employment as an engineer due to safety concerns. Despite this setback, he sought medical clearance through various examinations and consultations with doctors to resume service. His case highlights the stringent health standards required by railroad companies during the early 20th century.",
