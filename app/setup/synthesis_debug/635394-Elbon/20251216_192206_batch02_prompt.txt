His blood pressure this date was 148/80, his urine was negative for albumen and sugar.
I was unable to detect any heart murmur at this time. There was a slight increase in the heart rate but this may have been due entirely to nervousness. The rate when he was in the office here was 88. After sitting down several minutes, the rate was

Dr. Baker,
Dr. Stine:

On February 19th, 1940, Dr. Baker examined at Cumberland for position of Fireman, Leo V. Elbon, returning from furlough of 1927, and rejected him because of the existence of a faint systolic mitral murmur. Mr. H. J. Forch, general chairman of the Firemen's organization in Cumberland, wrote me on April 29th that Elbon was examined on March 31st, 1941 by Dr. Basil L. Page, who reported that he was in good health. Mr. Forch requested that we afford Elbon another examination, and I wrote him on May 6th that he might have Elbon call upon Dr. Gutswhite in Cumberland on one of his regular office days.

I find, however, Mr. Forch has written Mr. Elbon that since he resides in Buckhannon, W. Va., it might be more convenient for him to call upon one of you during your regular office days.

If suitable to you, this arrangement and if Elbon calls upon you I wish you would examine him quite carefully, particularly with reference t

Referring further to yours of March 26th and mine of March 28th, regarding the case of Fireman Leo V. Elbon, Cumberland Division, who was rejected for membership in the Relief Department and for employment.

It is not felt that we are justified in dropping a man's name from the seniority roster simply because his physical condition is such that he is unable to perform the duties required of men in train and engine service. It is therefore, suggested that this man's record be marked "Incapacitated for train service - Date", and that his name be continued on the roster.

It will therefore, be satisfactory to drop this man's name from the Fireman's Seniority Roster on account of physical disability.
