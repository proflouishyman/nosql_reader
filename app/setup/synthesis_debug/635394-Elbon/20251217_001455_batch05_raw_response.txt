  "biographical_narrative": "Leo V. Elbon was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company from at least 1927 onwards, initially working as a Fireman and later transitioning to roles in personnel management. He experienced several periods of disability due to illness, notably influenza in February 1933 and again in March 1927, which required medical attention and sick leave. His employment spanned different departments including the ET Department and General Personnel Division, with his location primarily being Grafton, West Virginia. Elbon's career was marked by periods of disablement and return to duty, reflecting the challenges faced by railroad workers during this era.",
