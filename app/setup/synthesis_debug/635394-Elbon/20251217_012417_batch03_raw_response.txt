  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon was a fireman for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, serving in Cumberland Division. His career spanned several decades, marked by periods of furlough and re-examination due to health concerns. In 1940, he faced rejection from service due to a faint systolic murmur detected during a medical examination but was later cleared after further tests in 1941. Elbon's application for full membership in the Relief Feature of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company’s Relief Department indicates his commitment to securing benefits and support through company programs. His records show a dedication to maintaining employment despite health challenges, reflecting the resilience required by railroad workers during this era.",
