  "biographical_narrative": "Leo V. Elbon was a long-serving employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O), beginning his career as early as 1927 in various capacities including Fireman and Personnel roles. His employment spanned several decades, during which he experienced multiple periods of disablement due to sickness, primarily influenza. These incidents occurred in 1927 and 1937, indicating a pattern of health issues that affected his ability to work. Despite these challenges, Elbon remained committed to his duties and resumed work after each period of disability. His career also included administrative roles within the company's personnel department, suggesting a progression from operational positions to more managerial responsibilities.",
