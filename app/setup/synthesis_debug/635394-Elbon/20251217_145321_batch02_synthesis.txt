  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman around 1920. He was employed in various roles within the Conducting Transportation Department, primarily serving on the Cumberland Division. In 1961, he suffered an off-duty injury to his left knee and facial lacerations, which required medical attention but no immediate return to work due to a questionable avulsion fracture of the intercondylar eminence of the tibia. Despite his injuries, Elbon's employment record shows periods of furlough and incapacitation for train service, indicating ongoing health issues that affected his ability to perform his duties. His career with B&O Railroad spanned several decades, during which he also applied for membership in the Relief Feature, a benefit program designed to support employees and their families.",
