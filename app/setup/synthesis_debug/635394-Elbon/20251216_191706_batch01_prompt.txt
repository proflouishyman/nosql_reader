Dear Doctor Adams:

I have examined the roentgen studies on Mr. Leo Elbon and submit the following report:

Roentgen examination of the SKULL at the Keyser Hospital Corp. in Keyser, West Virginia on 9-5-61 reveals the calvarium to be of normal texture and density with no evidence of old or recent fracture. The sella turcica is normal in size and contour without erosion or destruction. The petrous and sphenoidal ridges are normal.

Roentgen examination of the RT. KNEE at the Keyser Hospital Corp. on 9-5-61 reveals an avulsion fracture of the intercondylar eminences without displacement or deformity of the avulsed fragment. The avulsed fragment measures about 3 cm. in diameter with the fracture line entering the inner aspect of each tibial table. The joint space is of normal width. The patella is normal.

This refers to your letter of October 2, 1961, relative to the above named employee of this Company, who sustained an off duty injury to his left knee with laceration of the nose and chin. He was a patient at Potomac Valley Hospital from September 3 to 5, 1961, at which time x-ray revealed questionable fracture of his left knee. You requested an opinion and forwarded the x-rays here for interpretation.
They were referred to Dr. T. R. Adams at University Hospital, who called me shortly thereafter.

Dear Dr. Kaplan:

Mr. Leo Elbon was admitted to the Potomac Valley Hospital on 9-3-61, complaining of painful left knee and laceration of his nose and chin. He was discharged from the hospital on 9-5-61. X-rays at that time showed questionable fracture, intercondylar, of the left knee. I had the films reviewed by the radiologist, who agreed. The patient refused any treatment; namely, immobilization and plaster cast, etc.

Repeat x-rays on 9-25-61 showed further extension of the fracture according to the radiologist. The patient denies any symptoms, is walking, and wants to go back to work. The patient is seen today, which is 10-2-61. There is no particular change. I am forwarding x-ray films to you in order th

SUMMARY:
This is a hospital letter from Potomac Valley Hospital, written by Dr. Robert W. McCoy Jr. to Dr. I. Kaplan. The letter discusses the case of Leo Elbon, who was admitted to the hospital on 9-3-61 with a left knee injury and facial lacerations. X-rays indicated a questionable intercondylar fracture of the left knee. Despite medical advice, the patient refused immobilization or cast. Follow-up x-rays on 9-25-61 showed an extension of the fracture, but the patient is asymptomatic and wants to return to work. Dr. McCoy is asking Dr. Kaplan to review the x-rays and provide recommendations, indicating he doesn't think Elbon should return to work yet.
