  "biographical_narrative": "Leo Verne Elbon, born in 1896, served as a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career began in the early 20th century with his application for membership in the Relief Feature of the company's Relief Department in 1922. By January 1926, Elbon was working in Cumberland and underwent medical examinations to ensure he met the vision and hearing standards required by the railroad. In May 1927, his employment record shows a termination as 'Fireman,' but it is unclear if this represents a permanent end of service or a temporary furlough. On September 3, 1961, Elbon suffered an off-duty injury to his left knee and facial lacerations, which led to medical evaluations and discussions about his fitness for work. Despite recommendations from multiple doctors that he remain incapacitated until healing was confirmed, Elbon expressed a desire to return to work prematurely.",
