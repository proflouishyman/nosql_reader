  "biographical_narrative": "Leo V. Elbon began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in December of 1920 as a fireman on the Cumberland Division. His employment was marked by periods of furlough and medical examinations due to a faint systolic mitral murmur, which initially disqualified him from service in February 1940 upon returning from a long furlough starting July 8th, 1927. Despite this setback, Elbon sought re-examination and was eventually found fit for duty by Dr. Basil L. Page on March 3rd, 1941. However, the medical director advised that he be further examined to confirm his fitness before resuming service.",
