He worked in the CT Department of the Cumberland Division and resided at 40 Sharpless Street in Keyser, West Virginia. His career was marked by a significant injury sustained off-duty on September 3, 1961, which resulted in lacerations to his nose and chin and an intercondylar fracture of his left tibia. This injury led to a period of disability that lasted from September 4, 1961, until November 20, 1961. During this time, Elbon was not allowed wages due to his inability to work. His recovery and return to duty were closely monitored by the company's medical examiners and relief department.",

In May 1927, his employment record shows a termination as 'Fireman,' but it is unclear if this represents a permanent end of service or a temporary furlough. On September 3, 1961, Elbon suffered an off-duty injury to his left knee and facial lacerations, which led to medical evaluations and discussions about his fitness for work. Despite recommendations from multiple doctors that he remain incapacitated until healing was confirmed, Elbon expressed a desire to return to work prematurely.",

However, subsequent examinations in 1941 found him fit for duty after no heart murmurs were detected and his blood pressure was within normal range. Elbon's career also involved participation in the Relief Department of the railroad company, where he contributed monthly to secure benefits.",

Despite this setback, Elbon was not removed from the seniority roster but marked 'Incapacitated for train service.' In 1941, he sought re-examination to determine fitness for duty, indicating a desire to return to active service.",
