  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. His employment record reflects a series of injuries and recoveries, indicating he was likely engaged in physically demanding work such as laborer or brakeman. On July 25, 1913, Antonio sustained an injury while tightening nuts on a rail car, which resulted in a slight laceration above his right eyebrow. He was examined by medical personnel and returned to duty on August 1, 1913. The records also indicate that he had another period of disablement due to an accident reported on July 25, 1913, but the exact nature of this incident is not detailed in the documents provided.",
