  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso was a car repairer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. His career spanned several years and involved multiple injuries that temporarily disabled him from work. In May of 1915, he suffered two notable incidents: first, an injury to his left cheek on May 1st, which was a laceration about 3 1/4 inches long; secondly, on May 17th, he sustained another injury while tightening nuts on the end of a car, where a wrench slipped and struck him in the face. Both incidents required medical attention but did not result in prolonged disability. Mancuso was able to return to work within days after each incident.",
