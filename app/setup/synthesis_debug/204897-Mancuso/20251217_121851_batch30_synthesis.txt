  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a carman for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. His career spanned several decades, beginning in the early 1920s as evidenced by his membership certificate dated April 11, 1923. Throughout his tenure with B&O, he faced multiple health challenges including an injury on duty at Glenwood, PA, on January 27, 1944, and a period of disability due to influenza and cholecystitis in late 1947. Mancuso's personal life was marked by the death of his wife Maria, after which he sought to change the beneficiary of his insurance policy to his daughter Ella Mae Klimick.",
