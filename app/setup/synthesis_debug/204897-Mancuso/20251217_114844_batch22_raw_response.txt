His employment spanned several divisions within the company, including the Ogle Division and the Connellsville Division. In October 1928, he suffered an accident that resulted in a lacerated nose, for which he received disability payments.

His last recorded work date was January 3, 1938, after which he sought to continue his membership with the company’s relief department.",
