  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso, born in 1887, was a car repairman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. He worked primarily out of Connellsville and Culleo, Pennsylvania, where he faced several injuries on the job. His career with the railroad included multiple instances of injury that required medical attention and compensation from the company's relief department. Despite these setbacks, Mancuso continued to work as a car repairman until his last documented injury in 1924.",
