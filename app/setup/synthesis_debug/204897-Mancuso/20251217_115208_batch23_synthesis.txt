  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a long-serving employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, primarily working as a car repairman or helper in various divisions. He began his career around 1927 and held positions such as Carman Helper and Can Repair worker within the Motive Power Department. His employment was marked by several injuries, notably a laceration and contusion to his nose on October 13, 1928, which kept him out of work for about ten days. Mancuso also experienced a furlough in February 1927 but returned to temporary service shortly after. He was married with five children under the age of eighteen and maintained membership in the company's Relief Department for natural death benefits.",
