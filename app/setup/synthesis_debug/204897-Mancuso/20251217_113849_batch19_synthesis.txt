  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso was a car repairman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His employment record spans from at least December 1915 through July 10, 1918. He experienced multiple injuries during his tenure, including a contused left patella in December 1916 and another injury to his knee on December 2, 1916, both of which occurred while he was on duty. Mancuso's career is marked by several instances where he was temporarily disabled due to workplace accidents, indicating the hazardous nature of his job as a car repairman. Despite these setbacks, he continued working for the railroad company and was able to return to work after each injury.",
