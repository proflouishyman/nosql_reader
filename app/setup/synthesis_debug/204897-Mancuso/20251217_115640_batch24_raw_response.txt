  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a carman around 1929. His employment records indicate he worked in the Maintenance of Property (M.P.) Department under various divisions, including Pittsburgh and Connellsville. Throughout his tenure, Mancuso experienced several periods of disability due to influenza, which affected his work from January through February 1931 and again in July 1931. Despite these health challenges, he continued to serve the railroad company until at least June 15, 1936, when a physical examination confirmed that he was physically qualified for his position.",
