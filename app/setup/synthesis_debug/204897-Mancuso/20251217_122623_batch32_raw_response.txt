  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was employed as a carman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the Pittsburgh Division. His career spanned several years during which he faced multiple health challenges that affected his employment status. In February of 1953, Mancuso suffered from lumbago, leading to a period of disability and medical leave. He was able to return to duty after receiving treatment for this condition. Later in the year, on June 26, 1953, he sustained an injury while on duty at Glenwood, Pennsylvania, resulting in a lacerated wound to his left forehead that required four sutures. These incidents highlight the physical demands of Mancuso's job and the medical support provided by the railroad company during this period.",
