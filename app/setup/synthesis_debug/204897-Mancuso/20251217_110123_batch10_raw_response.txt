  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso was a worker for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) during the early 20th century. His career with B&O spanned several years and involved various positions including car repairman and clerk. In March of 1913, he suffered an injury to his left hand while holding a chisel when struck by another worker's hammer on duty. This incident led to a period of disability during which Mancuso did not receive wages but was eligible for benefits from the company’s Relief Department. He returned to work in early March 1913, after being declared fit for duty by medical examiners. His career with B&O also included periods when he reported sick due to influenza and other illnesses.",
