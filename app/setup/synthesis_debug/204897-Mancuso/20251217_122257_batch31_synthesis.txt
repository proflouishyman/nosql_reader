  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a long-serving employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. Born in 1886, he began his career as a car inspector and later held positions such as motorcarman and laborer. His employment spanned several decades, with notable injuries occurring on January 27, 1944, and August 18, 1946. Mancuso's work was characterized by dedication to the railroad industry, despite suffering from physical ailments that affected his ability to perform his duties. He faced a significant disability due to lumbago in February 1953, which led to a period of medical leave and eventual return to duty.",
