  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso was a car repairman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. He began his career as a car repairer and continued to work at this position, facing several injuries that required medical attention and relief benefits from the company. His first recorded injury occurred on July 25, 1913, when he sustained a laceration above his right eye while tightening bolts with a wrench. Mancuso was married and resided in Connellsville, Pennsylvania. He also suffered another injury to his finger in 1916, which led to a period of disability from July 19th to July 25th, during which he did not receive wages.",
