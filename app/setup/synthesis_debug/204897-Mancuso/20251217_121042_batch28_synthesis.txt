  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso, a carman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, had a career marked by several periods of disability due to illness. He began his employment in the Maintenance of Way (M.P.) department and was stationed in Pittsburgh (Pgh) division. His first notable period of disablement occurred from December 25, 1946, through January 19, 1947, due to influenza. Another significant event was a relapse of his illness from November 26, 1946, to February 24, 1948, which included periods of disability for influenza and cholecystitis. Despite these health challenges, Mancuso managed to return to duty multiple times, indicating resilience in the face of recurring medical issues.",
