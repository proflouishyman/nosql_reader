January 25, 1938
Mr. Hindsley,
Supt. of Relief Dept.
Baltimore, Md.
Dear Sir:
On Dec. 30 I paid my Relief dues for January. On January 3 I got a day's work at the shops. When I got my pay, I found out that they took out Relief dues. $3.90 instead of the furlough dues of $2.10. They also made it for January, which should have been for February. Would you please try to straighten out this matter for me? Thank you.
Mr. Luigi Mancuso
111 Pulaski Street
Connellsville

SUMMARY:
The letter, dated January 25, 1938, is written by Mr. Luigi Mancuso to the Superintendent of the Relief Department in Baltimore. Mr. Mancuso explains that he paid his relief dues for January on December 30. However, upon receiving his pay for a day's work on January 3, he noticed an incorrect deduction; $3.90 was taken instead of the proper furlough dues of $2.10. Furthermore, the deduction was mistakenly applied for January rather than February. Mr. Mancuso requests assistance to correct this issue.
