  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso, born in 1888, began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a car repairman at Connellsville Division. His employment was marked by periods of dismissal and reapplication for positions within the company. In December 1909, he was dismissed due to involvement in a strike but sought reemployment shortly thereafter. Despite initial correspondence indicating potential rehire, Mancuso faced another dismissal on January 12, 1910. His application for full membership in the Relief Feature of the Railroad's Relief Department reflects his commitment to securing benefits and support from the company during uncertain times. Throughout his career, he demonstrated a persistent effort to maintain employment with the railroad despite setbacks.",
