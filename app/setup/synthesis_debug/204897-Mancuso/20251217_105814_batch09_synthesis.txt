  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso, a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, had an eventful career marked by injuries sustained while working. His employment began sometime before June 1905 when he was injured on duty in Coville, Pennsylvania. He suffered a contused shin and later a lacerated right hand from being struck by a rock while on duty. These incidents led to periods of disability during which Mancuso received benefits from the company's Relief Department. Despite these setbacks, he managed to return to work after medical clearance was given in September 1905.",
