His career with the railroad included several notable events, particularly his injury on February 5, 1936, when he caught his left thumb in the truck of a car while replacing a wheel at Glenwood, Pennsylvania. This resulted in significant medical attention and time off work due to the severity of the wound involving flexor tendons and circulatory damage. Mancuso's injury was well-documented through multiple reports and correspondence, reflecting the company\u2019s detailed record-keeping for employee health and safety incidents.",
