  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a car repairman. His employment spanned several years and involved various positions within the Mechanical Department at different divisions including Cville and Chicago. A significant event in his career was an injury sustained on April 17, 1922, when he suffered a contused wound to his left great toe while on duty due to a piece of timber falling on it. This incident led to a period of disability during which Mancuso received medical attention and compensation from the company's Relief Department. He was able to return to work by May 1st, 1922. Another notable event occurred in December 1913 when he reported a neck injury while not on duty, leading to another period of disability.",
