  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso was a car repairman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily in Connellsville, Pennsylvania. His employment history shows periods of service from at least 1903 to 1922, with interruptions due to labor disputes and personal loans. In 1917, he left his position but returned shortly after, necessitating a reevaluation for membership in the Relief Department through a medical examination. Mancuso's career was marked by periods of financial strain, as evidenced by his need for relief payments during labor troubles and his participation in the company\u2019s loan program. He maintained active service with occasional loans and underwent periodic health assessments to ensure continued eligibility for employment.",
