  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a car repairman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. He began his career as early as 1907, working primarily out of Connellsville, Pennsylvania. Throughout his tenure with the railroad company, he experienced several injuries and periods of sickness that required medical attention and compensation from the Relief Department. Injuries included a contused left hand in February 1913 and another injury to his left hand in March 1916. These incidents were reported as unavoidable accidents occurring during work duties at the repair track. Mancuso also experienced a period of sickness in October 1907, for which he received benefits for nine days. His career with the railroad company was marked by these medical events and his consistent return to duty after receiving treatment.",
