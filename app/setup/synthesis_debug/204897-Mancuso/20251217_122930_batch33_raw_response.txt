  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a long-serving employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, with an extensive career spanning over five decades. He began his service as early as 1905 in various capacities, including machinist and carman helper, working primarily out of Glenwood, Pennsylvania. On June 26, 1953, Mancuso suffered a lacerated wound to his left forehead when struck by a piece of iron at work; he was treated and returned to work shortly thereafter. His career culminated in retirement on January 5, 1955, due to pension benefits. Throughout his tenure, Mancuso maintained membership in the Relief Department for natural death benefits, which continued even after his retirement.",
