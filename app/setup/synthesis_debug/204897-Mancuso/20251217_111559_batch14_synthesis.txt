  "biographical_narrative": "Antone Mancuso was a brakeman and car repairman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. His career spanned several years during which he faced significant injuries, notably on July 19, 1916, when his hand was caught by a coupler while working at Connellsville, Pennsylvania yards. This injury led to a period of disability and medical examination before he returned to duty on July 26, 1916. Mancuso's records indicate that he was married and resided in Connellsville, where he faced other health issues such as typhoidal fever, which kept him from work for several months in 1909.",
