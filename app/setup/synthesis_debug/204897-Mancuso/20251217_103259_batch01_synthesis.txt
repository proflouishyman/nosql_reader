  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various capacities throughout his career. His employment records indicate a complex history involving periods of disablement and return to duty. In early 1908, he claimed benefits due to sickness but returned to work by January 27th of that year. Mancuso's career saw him working as both a laborer and in the Motive Power Department, with his last known position being a car repairer. His employment was interrupted by periods of leave for health reasons, including an instance where he left service in 1917 but returned in March 1919, necessitating a new physical examination to regain Relief Department membership.",
