  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various capacities throughout his career. His employment records indicate a complex history involving periods of disablement and return to duty. In early 1908, he claimed benefits due to sickness but returned to work by January 27th of that year. Mancuso's career saw him working as both a laborer and in the Motive Power Department, with his last known position being a car repairer. His employment was interrupted by periods of leave for health reasons, including an instance where he left service in 1917 but returned in March 1919, necessitating a new physical examination to regain Relief Department membership.",

Both incidents required medical attention but did not result in prolonged disability. Mancuso was able to return to work within days after each incident.",

Department around 1913, as indicated by his eight years of service noted on January 23, 1921. Throughout his employment, he faced several injuries that required medical attention and temporary disability benefits. On January 18, 1921, Mancuso suffered a contused wound to his right foot at the base of his little toe while working in Connellsville shops. He returned to work on January 24, 1921. Another injury occurred on November 18, 1921, when he was jacking up a tank and the jack fell on his foot, causing another contusion. Mancuso's career with the railroad company is marked by these injuries and the subsequent medical examinations and disability benefits.",

His career with the railroad included work in different departments such as M.P., M.O., and M.W., and he worked across divisions including Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and possibly others. Mancuso experienced multiple periods of disablement due to sickness and injury, which affected his ability to perform his duties. He was reported disabled on several occasions, with the most detailed records indicating a relapse from influenza and cervical litis in early 1948. Throughout these disablements, he did not receive wages, but there is no indication of any disputes regarding medical findings or payments.",
