  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a carman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various capacities from at least late 1947 to early 1948. His career with the railroad included work in different departments such as M.P., M.O., and M.W., and he worked across divisions including Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and possibly others. Mancuso experienced multiple periods of disablement due to sickness and injury, which affected his ability to perform his duties. He was reported disabled on several occasions, with the most detailed records indicating a relapse from influenza and cervical litis in early 1948. Throughout these disablements, he did not receive wages, but there is no indication of any disputes regarding medical findings or payments.",
