  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) during the early 20th century. His employment history includes positions such as Carmen Freight and Car Repairman, with his career spanning multiple divisions including Pittsburgh and Coville. He experienced significant periods of furlough and reinstatement, notably being reemployed in October 1933 and reinstated on November 16, 1936. Mancuso's employment was marked by several injuries that led to temporary disablement, such as a sprained knee sustained on June 19, 1924, which required medical examination and compensation for lost workdays. His career with the B&O also involved administrative actions like physical examinations for reinstatement after long periods of furlough.",
