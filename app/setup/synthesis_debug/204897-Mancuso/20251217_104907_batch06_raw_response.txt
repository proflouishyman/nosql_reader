  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a car repairman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career spanned several decades, during which he faced multiple health challenges that affected his employment status. In April 1914, Mancuso experienced a furuncle on his neck but recovered quickly enough to return to work shortly thereafter. However, in February 1936, he suffered an injury at Glenwood, Pennsylvania, when he caught his thumb in the truck of a car while replacing a wheel. This incident led to extended medical treatment and several bills from Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh. Mancuso was furloughed for some time but eventually returned to work. His case highlights the challenges faced by railroad workers during this period, including injuries, medical treatments, and the administrative processes involved with worker's compensation.",
