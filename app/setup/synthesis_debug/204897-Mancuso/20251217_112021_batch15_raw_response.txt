  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. His employment records indicate that he experienced several periods of sickness which required medical attention and benefits from the company's Relief Department. These incidents included typhoid fever in 1909, for which he received benefits for 23 days at $1 per day, and another period of disability due to an unspecified illness in 1911. Mancuso was able to return to his duties after each incident following medical clearance from the company's medical examiner.",
