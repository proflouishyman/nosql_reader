  "biographical_narrative": "Luigi Mancuso began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a laborer in Connellsville, Pennsylvania. His employment spanned several years from at least October 1912 to July 1926. Over this period, he transitioned into roles such as car repairer and engineer within the Motive Power Department. Mancuso's career was marked by his consistent applications for full membership in the Relief Feature of the company’s Relief Department, which provided him with a safety net against potential financial hardships due to illness or injury. His family situation is notable, including his marriage to Maria Mancuso and his designation as beneficiary for her welfare. Despite some confusion over his name variations across documents, Luigi's dedication to his work and the company is evident from his multiple applications and certifications.",
