  "biographical_narrative": "Antonio Mancuso began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a car repairman. His work spanned several decades and involved various positions within different departments and divisions of the company, including Car Repair in the Maintenance of Way (M of W) department and Oiler in the Maintenance of Power (MB) division. Mancuso's employment was marked by multiple instances of disability due to both accidents and sickness, which required him to undergo medical examinations and receive compensation from the Relief Department. Despite these setbacks, he demonstrated resilience and returned to duty on several occasions after his periods of disablement.",
