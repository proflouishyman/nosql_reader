  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a Yard Helper, working primarily in the Curtis Bay division. His employment spanned several decades, during which he experienced various medical examinations and changes in job status. In August 1952, Steinecker was diagnosed with generalized arteriosclerosis, leading to indefinite disablement. He subsequently applied for an annuity from the Railroad Retirement Board based on his age and service length, effective February 21, 1953. Throughout his career, he maintained membership in the Relief Feature of the company’s Relief Department, which provided him with death benefits and other forms of support.",
