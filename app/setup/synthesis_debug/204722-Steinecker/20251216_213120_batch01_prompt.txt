Mr. C. W. Galloway., Supt.,
Baltimore, Md.

Dear Sir:
I return herewith a letter of W. E. Cavey, R. F. of relative to Wm. Stanecker's claim for benefits from April to Aug., 03, received with your letter of Sept. 30th, 1904. The Relief Dept. has paid Stanecker benefits from Jan. 19th to May 31st, 1903, inclusive. Mr. Tearney, who had charge of the case reported that Stanecker was able to resume duty on Sept. 1st, 1903, and checks in payment of benefits from June 1st to Aug. 31st, 1903, were sent to the examiner to be delivered to the member. After the releases were read to Stanecker he refused to sign the same or accept the checks. The case was closed as of Aug. 31st, 1903, and the checks last referred to are held in this office. Claim Agent Shaw had the case in hand last spring, but I do not know how he disposed of it.

Very respectfully,
