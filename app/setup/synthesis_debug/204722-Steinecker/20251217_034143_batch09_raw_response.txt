  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker was a foreman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in Division 6 of the Track Department. His career with the railroad is marked by several instances of disability due to sickness and heat exhaustion. In June 1911, he took leave due to illness and did not receive wages during this period. Steinecker also experienced a significant episode of heat exhaustion in June 1914 that required medical attention from Dr. R.V. Glann. He was unable to work for several days before returning to duty on July 27, 1914. His career with the railroad appears to have been characterized by periods of illness and recovery.",
