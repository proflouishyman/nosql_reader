  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker, born on January 17, 1883, began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in an unspecified role around 1910-1911. His employment records indicate he worked as a fireman and brakeman at various times during his tenure. Over the years, Steinecker experienced several periods of disability due to sickness or injury, including instances where he was reported sick on January 3, 1918, and December 24, 1913. He also suffered from heat exhaustion in June 1914. Despite these setbacks, he continued his employment with the railroad company until at least 1922, when he returned to duty after a short disability period.",
