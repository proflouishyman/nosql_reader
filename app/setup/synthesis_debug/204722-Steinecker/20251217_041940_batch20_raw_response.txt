  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker was a Yard Helper employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career with the railroad spanned several years during which he faced numerous health challenges that led to periods of disability. From August 16, 1952, through January 10, 1953, Steinecker experienced multiple episodes of sickness and was unable to work for extended periods. Each episode resulted in a certificate of disablement from the Relief Department, indicating that he did not receive wages during these times. His medical records show that he had an asthmatic condition which required ongoing attention. Despite his health issues, there is no indication that Steinecker left the company or was promoted; rather, he remained as a Yard Helper throughout the documented period.",
