  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker, a foreman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, worked primarily within the Department of C. T., Division Balto. His career spanned several years, during which he faced significant occupational hazards typical of railroad work in the early 20th century. On May 25, 1928, Steinecker suffered a severe workplace injury when his fingers were lacerated while climbing on a gondola car at Seawall, Maryland. The incident left him disabled for approximately two weeks, during which he was compensated by the company's Relief Department. Despite this setback, Steinecker returned to duty on June 7, 1928, and continued his service with the railroad.",
