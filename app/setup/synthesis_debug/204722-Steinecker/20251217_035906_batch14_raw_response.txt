  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker, a brakeman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O), began his career with the company around late spring or early summer of 1918. His employment was marked by an injury on August 4, 1918, when he fell over a switch bolt at Curtis Bay and suffered a deep laceration to his right leg. This incident led to temporary disability, during which Steinecker received benefits from the company's Relief Department. He returned to work on August 14, 1918, after medical clearance. Throughout this period, there were administrative issues with forms being incorrectly signed or lacking necessary signatures, indicating some procedural challenges within the B&O’s documentation process.",
