  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker was a dedicated employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career began in the early 20th century, where he served as a fireman and later as yard help. Throughout his tenure, he faced several health challenges that affected his work. In February 1912, he suffered an injury to his right finger while on duty at Curtiss Bay, which required medical attention from Dr. R.V. Glann. Despite initial difficulties in proving the extent of his disability, Steinecker was eventually able to return to duty after receiving necessary treatment and certification. His career also included a visual and hearing examination conducted in 1929, indicating ongoing health monitoring by the company.",
