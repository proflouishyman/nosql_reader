Mr. H. C. Johnson,
Yard Master,
Curtis Bay.

Baltimore, Md., Sept. 10, 8.

Dear Sir:

I am returning herewith form 790 in the case of William Steinecker, 5 #35390 and call your attention to the fact that this is signed by the man himself without showing the names of any witnesses. Were there any to the accident? If so, show their names. As this man is a brakeman this form should be signed by his conductor.
Kindly have this corrected and returned to me at once as delay holds up the man's benefits.

Yours truly,

Medical Examiner.
