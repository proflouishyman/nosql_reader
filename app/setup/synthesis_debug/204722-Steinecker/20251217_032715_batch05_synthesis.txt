  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker began his career as a fireman with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company around the early 1900s, based on available documents. His employment spanned several years and involved various positions within the railroad system. He experienced multiple injuries during his tenure, including an incident in November 1910 where he was sick and unable to work for a period, and another injury in July 1911 when he hurt his second cone finger. Steinecker also had at least one accident on February 9, 1912, where he injured his hand while working as a fireman. Throughout these incidents, Steinecker received medical attention and was provided with disability benefits by the company's Relief Department.",
