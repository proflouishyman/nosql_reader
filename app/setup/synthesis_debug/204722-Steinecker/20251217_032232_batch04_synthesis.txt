  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker began his career with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman on January 6th, 1903. He was injured while learning the road just twelve days later, on January 18th, which led to him being placed on disability benefits. Throughout the early part of 1903, Steinecker's case was managed by various medical examiners and administrators due to difficulties in locating him for inspections at his home address. He reported for inspections at Mount Clare instead. His condition involved a purulent discharge from the ear, which caused significant health issues and led to multiple examinations and claims for benefits. By April 12th, 1907, Steinecker had undergone another medical examination that indicated he was fit for duty without glasses, though his left eye vision was slightly impaired.",
