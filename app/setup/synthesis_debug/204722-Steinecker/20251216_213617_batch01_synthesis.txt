  "biographical_narrative": "William N. Steinecker was a fireman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. His career began with his employment as a fireman, and he faced significant challenges when he was severely injured in an engine explosion on January 18, 1903, at Monrovia, Maryland. The injury left him hospitalized for several months, during which time he received benefits from the company's Relief Department. After being discharged from hospital care, Steinecker continued to receive medical treatment and compensation until his recovery was certified in September of that year. Despite his injuries, Steinecker returned to work as a fireman but faced disputes over benefit payments for June through August 1903, which he refused to accept or sign releases for.",
