  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker, born in 1882, served as a brakeman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career was marked by several periods of disability due to sickness and accidents. In November 1920, he suffered an injury at Curtis Bay, Maryland, which led to his temporary disablement. Steinecker also experienced another disabling event in August 1918 when he sustained a lacerated leg while working. These incidents required him to seek medical attention and claim benefits from the Relief Department of the B&O Railroad Company. Despite these setbacks, he was able to return to duty after each incident with no significant disputes over his claims.",
