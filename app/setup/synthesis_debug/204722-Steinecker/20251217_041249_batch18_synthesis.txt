  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker, born in 1882, was a long-serving employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O). His career spanned several decades, during which he held various positions including brakeman and yard foreman. He experienced multiple periods of disablement due to both accidents and sicknesses, such as appendicitis and muscle cramps. Steinecker's records indicate that his health issues occasionally interrupted his work but did not prevent him from resuming duties after recovery. Despite the challenges, he remained a dedicated employee until at least 1937.",
