William Heinecker

DEAR SIR:
I have notice that you were disabled on 2/9/12 and have not been able to obtain satisfactory evidence that you were sufficiently disabled to entitle you to benefits.
The rules of this Department require the recommendation of Medical Examiner before benefits are paid. You are, therefore, requested to furnish me, on or before 3/1/12 with such evidence as you may be able to produce, in the way of affidavit or physician's certificate, or both; otherwise, I will return the papers to the Superintendent of the Relief Department without my recommendation.
Very respectfully,
[Signature]
Medical Examiner.
3.1.12


SUMMARY:
The document is a letter from The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company's Relief Department, Office of Medical Examiner, to an employee named William Heinecker, a fireman. It notifies him that although he reported being disabled on February 9, 1912, he has not provided sufficient evidence to justify disability benefits. The letter requests that he submit supporting documents, such as an affidavit or a physician's certificate, by March 1, 1912. Without this, the Medical Examiner will return the papers without recommendation for benefits.
