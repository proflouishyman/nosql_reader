  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker was a railroad worker employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various capacities during the early 20th century. Initially serving as a fireman and later as a brakeman, Steinecker's career was marked by several periods of disability due to rheumatism, which affected his left leg. His employment records indicate that he faced significant health challenges, including an extended period of disability from February to July 1917. Despite these setbacks, Steinecker resumed duties multiple times after medical clearance and continued working for the railroad. The documents suggest a pattern of illness and recovery typical of workers in physically demanding jobs during this era.",
