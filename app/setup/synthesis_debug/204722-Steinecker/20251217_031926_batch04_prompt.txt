Supt. Barr:
Dear Sir:
Please refer to the case of Wm Steineska form 5 #45930. The case was in hands of Dr. Adams, Steineska being at Hospital Balto, until May 6, when it was transferred to me. The man lives a long mile or more beyond Westport. He has been going to Mt. Clare (main Eng's) for his check and for inspections. I have visited him at his home, but do not find him there. Since he is so inconveniently located and able to call for inspection, cannot I transfer his case back to Adams?
Very respectfully,
