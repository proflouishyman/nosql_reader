  "biographical_narrative": "William N. Steinecker was a fireman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. His career with the railroad involved several injury claims between April and August of 1903, suggesting he may have been prone to workplace accidents or had a particularly hazardous role as a fireman. The records indicate that Steinecker was entitled to benefits for various periods due to his injuries, which required him to be out of work for extended durations. His medical care was often provided at the Baltimore City Hospital under the Sisters of Mercy, and he received treatment in Westport, Maryland, where he resided or had family ties.",
