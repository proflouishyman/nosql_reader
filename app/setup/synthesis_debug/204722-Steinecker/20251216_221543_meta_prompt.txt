The injury left him hospitalized for several months, during which time he received benefits from the company's Relief Department. After being discharged from hospital care, Steinecker continued to receive medical treatment and compensation until his recovery was certified in September of that year. Despite his injuries, Steinecker returned to work as a fireman but faced disputes over benefit payments for June through August 1903, which he refused to accept or sign releases for.",
