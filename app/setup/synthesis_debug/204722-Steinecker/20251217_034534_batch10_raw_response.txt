  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker, a fireman for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, had a career marked by several health-related absences from work. His employment began in the early 1900s, though exact dates are not provided. He was involved in multiple incidents of disablement due to sickness or injury, which required him to seek medical attention and disability benefits. Steinecker's records show that he faced challenges with timely reporting and documentation for his claims, leading to some disputes over the validity of his disabilities. Despite these issues, he continued his service as a fireman until at least 1921 when he was reported as a Yard Foreman in Baltimore Penn Division.",
