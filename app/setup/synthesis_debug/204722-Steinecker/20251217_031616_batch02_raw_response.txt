  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinacker was a fireman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. He suffered severe burns and injuries on January 18, 1903, while working at Monrovia, which led to his hospitalization and subsequent benefits claim for disability. After receiving medical treatment and being paid benefits for several months, he was able to return to duty in September of the same year. However, due to the severity of his injuries, Steinacker was permanently relocated from Baltimore City Hospital to Westport, Maryland, where he continued to receive care under Dr. J. H. Tearney.",
