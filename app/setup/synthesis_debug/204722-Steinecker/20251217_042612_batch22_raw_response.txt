  "biographical_narrative": "William Steinecker began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman around the turn of the century. His employment records indicate that he was initially hired after passing a medical examination, which found him to be physically qualified for railroad work despite some large scars noted in one record. Throughout his tenure, Steinecker held positions such as Fireman and Yard Foreman, with evidence suggesting an application for full membership in the company's Relief Feature. His career spanned several decades, during which he faced at least one period of disablement due to sickness in 1882, though no further details on this incident are provided. Steinecker continued his service until at least 1943 when a comprehensive physical examination confirmed his fitness for duty.",
