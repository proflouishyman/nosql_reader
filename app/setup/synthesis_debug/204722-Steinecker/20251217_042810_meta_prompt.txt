He was injured while learning the road just twelve days later, on January 18th, which led to him being placed on disability benefits. Throughout the early part of 1903, Steinecker's case was managed by various medical examiners and administrators due to difficulties in locating him for inspections at his home address. He reported for inspections at Mount Clare instead. His condition involved a purulent discharge from the ear, which caused significant health issues and led to multiple examinations and claims for benefits. By April 12th, 1907, Steinecker had undergone another medical examination that indicated he was fit for duty without glasses, though his left eye vision was slightly impaired.",

His career spanned several decades, during which he faced at least one period of disablement due to sickness in 1882, though no further details on this incident are provided. Steinecker continued his service until at least 1943 when a comprehensive physical examination confirmed his fitness for duty.",
