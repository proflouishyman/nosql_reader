  "biographical_narrative": "William Nicholas Steinecker began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in January 1906 as a Fireman in the Conducting Transportation Department. Over the years, he held various positions within the company and was eventually promoted to Yard Helper at Curtis Bay. His employment spanned several decades until he became disabled due to generalized arteriosclerosis in August 1952. Steinecker's disability led him to apply for Railroad Retirement Board annuity benefits effective February 21, 1953. Throughout his career, Steinecker maintained membership in the Relief Feature of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company’s Relief Department, which provided natural death benefits.",
