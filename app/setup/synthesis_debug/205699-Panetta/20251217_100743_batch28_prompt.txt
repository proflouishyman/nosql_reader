May 19, 1959

Dear Sir:

Effective October 1, 1958, your contribution rate was reduced from $4.00 to $3.15 per month. Our records indicate that you paid contributions for the period 10/1/58 to 11/1/58 at the old rate of $4.00. An overpayment of $0.85 exists in your account. Therefore, if you have not already done so, you may, when making next payment of contributions, take credit for the overpayment of $0.85.

This letter may be presented to the nearest Agent of the Company, or to the Treasurer, Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., Baltimore 1, Md., as authority to adjust your account as outlined above.

Thereafter, contributions should be at the new monthly rate of $3.15 payable in advance, it being your privilege to pay as many months in advance as desired.

Yours truly,
[Signature]

SUMMARY:
This letter, issued by the Relief Department of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company and signed by Superintendent I. C. White, informs the recipient that their monthly contribution rate was reduced from $4.00 to $3.15 as of October 1, 1958. The recipient overpaid by $0.85 for one month, and the letter advises how to credit that overpayment on the next payment. Instructions are given for future payments, and the letter serves as official authority for adjusting the recipient's account accordingly.
