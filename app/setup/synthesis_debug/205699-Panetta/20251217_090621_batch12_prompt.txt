August 30, 1917.

Mr. I. Panmetto,
Laborer, Steel Car Plant,
Keyser, W. Va.,

Dear Sir:

Replying to your inquiry of the 25th instant, I beg to advise that you are a member of this department in class B $1.50 under application executed June 6, 1910. As you left the service in strike of July 1, 1917, 50¢ was refunded at that time account of unearned contributions for the balance of July. Because of your reinstatement on July 16th, it was necessary for the timekeeper to make deduction of 50¢ for July from the 16th to the 31st, and 50¢ August dues in advance, or a total of $1.00, on the second period of July roll.
I trust this explanation will be satisfactory.

Very respectfully,

Superintendent.

SUMMARY:
A letter dated August 30, 1917, from a Superintendent addresses Mr. I. Panmetto, a laborer at the Steel Car Plant in Keyser, West Virginia, explaining contributions and deductions related to his membership and dues after a strike and his reinstatement.
