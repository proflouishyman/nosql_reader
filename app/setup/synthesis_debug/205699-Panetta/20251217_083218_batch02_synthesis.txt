  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. His employment records indicate that he experienced several injuries on the job, including one incident in May 1906 where he received benefits for five days due to an unspecified injury. Another record from June 1906 shows he was entitled to benefits for a period of time but returned to duty shortly thereafter. The documents also suggest some confusion over his name and possibly his membership status within the company's relief department, as there are references to 'Larry Vannetta' which may be an error or another individual entirely.",
