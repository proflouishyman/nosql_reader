RIVERSIDE BUILDING
CUMBERLAND, MARYLAND
May 30/24
Dear Dr. Selby,
Louis Pacciutta came in for examination today and I can find no special trouble with the shoulder -- There is no wasting, no spasticity, no limitation of motion. He complains of pain -- X-ray shows no evidence of injury except a slight widening of the acromio-clavicular articulation. He probably sprained this joint. Work will benefit the shoulder if the pain is not too severe to allow it.
Yrs E. B. Claybrook

SUMMARY:
Dr. E. B. Claybrook reports to Dr. Selby regarding the patient Louis Pacciutta, who came in for an examination of shoulder pain. Upon examination and an X-ray, no significant shoulder injury or abnormality was found except a slight widening of the acromio-clavicular joint, likely indicating a sprain. The doctor suggests that work might improve the shoulder condition if the pain is tolerable.
