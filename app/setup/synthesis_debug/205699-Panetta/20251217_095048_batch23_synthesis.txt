  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta, born in 1875, was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. He began his career with the company and worked under the Maintenance of Way (M.P.) Department within the Cumberland Division. In September 1934, he suffered an injury that led to myalgia lumbalis and beginning cataracts, which resulted in disability payments from the railroad's Relief Department. After a period of investigation by the Railroad Retirement Board, Panetta was granted an annuity effective June 24, 1937, for which he received $22.01 per month. His case involved several administrative adjustments and repayments due to overpayments during his application process.",
