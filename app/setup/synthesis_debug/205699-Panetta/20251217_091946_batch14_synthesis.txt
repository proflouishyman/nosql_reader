  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was employed as a car repairman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company from at least April 1915 until July 1921. His career with the railroad company included several instances of injury and sickness, which led to periods of disability and medical attention. In April 1915, he reported strained muscles in his right shoulder and side of the neck after carrying a rail on his shoulder, though this did not result in him reporting off work. Later, in June 1919, Panetta was treated for acute bronchitis and nasal obstruction at Columbus Hospital in New York City, where he underwent surgery to correct deviation of the nasal septum and hypertrophy of the middle turbinate bone. He returned to duty on July 30, 1919. In January 1921, Panetta sustained a laceration to his thumb, which led to another period of disability and subsequent benefits until he was able to return to work in July of that year.",
