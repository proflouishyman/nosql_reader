Mr. Ilario Panetta, 86 Vernon Street, Keyser, W. Va.
Dear Sir:
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 19th in which you enclosed money-order for $1.45, presumably to cover your unpaid death benefits.
The records show that $5.45 was deducted from your earnings to cover February dues; but the Division Accountant does not know why you made no time from February 1 until todate. In view of the fact that you resumed duty on January 22nd, you need full dues from that date to the 31st and as you had paid your mutual death contributions during that period, the total amount now due is $5.45 to adjust your membership for January.
If it develops that you have been furloughed, or in other words your employing official stated there was no further work for you to perform and you have made no time on this account from the latter part of February to the present date, please so advise, and in the meantime, if you have a letter from your
