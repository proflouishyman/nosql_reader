  "biographical_narrative": "Louis Panetta began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in February 1907. Initially employed as a laborer, he was part of the Motive Power Department and later transferred to the Maintenance of Way Department at Cumberland Division. His application for full membership in the Relief Feature indicates that he took steps to secure financial protection against potential job-related injuries or illnesses. Despite some inconsistencies in his name across documents, Panetta's employment history with the railroad company is well-documented from 1907 onwards. There are no records of significant injuries or disputes during his tenure.",
