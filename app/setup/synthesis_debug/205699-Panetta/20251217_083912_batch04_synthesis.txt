  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) from at least 1911. His career included periods of injury and furlough, as well as disputes over payroll deductions and membership dues in the company's relief department. In May 1912, he suffered an accident that disabled him temporarily. By March 1934, Panetta was working extra shifts but had also been involved in a dispute regarding his membership dues and death benefits payments. His employment history shows resilience through periods of economic hardship and the challenges of maintaining company membership during times of furlough.",
