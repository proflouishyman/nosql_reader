  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was an engine helper for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in Keyser, West Virginia. He began his career with the company as early as 1924 and faced a significant injury on May 9, 1924, when he sustained a continuous shoulder disability while at work. The injury led to a period of disability from May 10-16, during which Panetta received compensation for lost wages and medical expenses. He was examined by several doctors and radiographers who confirmed the nature of his injury and monitored his recovery process. By May 17, he had been declared fit to return to duty, marking a successful resolution to his health crisis.",
