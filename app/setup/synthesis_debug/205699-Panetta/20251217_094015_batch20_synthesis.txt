  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in various capacities within the Maintenance of Way (M.P.) department. His career spanned several decades from at least the early 1920s to the early 1930s. Throughout his tenure, he experienced multiple periods of disablement due to illnesses such as influenza and rheumatism. These health issues led to temporary absences from work, during which Panetta received sickness payments. Despite these setbacks, there is no evidence of formal disputes or significant disciplinary actions against him. His family life included a wife named Teresa Panetta, who was designated as the beneficiary in his application for additional natural death benefits.",
