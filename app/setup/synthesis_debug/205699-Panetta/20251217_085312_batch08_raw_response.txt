  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in various capacities from at least 1906. His employment records indicate that he faced several administrative and medical challenges during his tenure. In 1906, there were issues with incomplete release forms related to him, suggesting some initial bureaucratic hurdles. By February 1932, Ilario had designated his wife Florence Panetta as the primary beneficiary for death benefits, with his daughter Nellie Demasi named as a contingent beneficiary if Florence predeceased him. The records also show that in August 1908, he received a refund of $66.02 due to a furlough, indicating periods when he was not actively employed but still maintained some connection to the company.",
