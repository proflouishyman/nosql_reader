  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (B&O) in West Virginia during the early 20th century. His employment spanned several decades, with records indicating his active participation from at least the early 1900s to the early 1930s. Throughout his career, Panetta experienced various periods of furlough and disability, including a significant hospitalization in February 1933 following an operation. He was particularly concerned about maintaining his insurance benefits during these times, often writing to the Relief Department to ensure proper deductions from his paychecks or direct payments for his relief dues. His letters reveal a meticulous attention to detail regarding benefit amounts and payment schedules, reflecting both personal financial concerns and a broader context of economic hardship during the Great Depression.",
