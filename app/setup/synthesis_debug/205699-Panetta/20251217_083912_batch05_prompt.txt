Cert. No. 205699 RDS/R
Baltimore, Md. January 20th, 1933.

Dr. Guidewhite:

Replying to your letter of January 17th, in connection with the case of Mr. Ilario Panetta, Laborer, Motive Power Department, Cumberland Division, we beg to advise that we have Form 790, in connection with disability reported on Form 5 No. 234605 of October 7th, 1931, which seems to establish the fact that a right inguinal hernia came on while he was on duty and a double truss was supplied for him on account of the large ring on the left side, the truss being paid for by the Department.

Therefore, if it becomes necessary for Mr. Panetta to be operated on, we feel that the Department will be justified in taking care of the expense of operation, the operation, of course, to be performed by a Company Surgeon.

E. V. Milholland.

SUMMARY:
The letter, dated January 20, 1933, and sent from Baltimore, addresses Dr. Guidewhite's inquiry regarding Mr. Ilario Panetta, a laborer in the Motive Power Department, Cumberland Division. It informs that forms documenting Mr. Panetta's disability related to a right inguinal hernia while on duty are on file, and a double truss was provided and paid for by the department. The letter advises that if surgery becomes necessary, the department will justify covering the costs, provided the surgery is performed by a company surgeon.

Dr. E. V. Mulholland,
Medical & Surgical Director.
Dear Doctor:
The above named member called at my office this morning claiming inability to continue at his work because of a right inguinal hernia which he claims to be the result of an accident while on duty Oct. 7th, 1931 as per the above form 5 number shown on form 17a in this office.
Upon examination we found Mr. Panetta to have a definite right inguinal hernia and also an incomplete left inguinal hernia. I informed him that I was unable to secure lighter work for him and that the only cure for his condition was surgical treatment. He then made inquiry as to whether or not the Company would pay all cost incurred by the correction of both hernias. Please advise so that I may know how you
