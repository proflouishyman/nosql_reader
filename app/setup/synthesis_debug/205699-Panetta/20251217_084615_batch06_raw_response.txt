  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in various capacities within the Labor Department. His career with the railroad spanned several years during which he experienced multiple health issues that affected his work. In October 1931, Panetta reported an injury at work involving lifting heavy beds, leading to a right inguinal hernia. Despite this incident, he continued working until October 27th of the same year. A more severe disability occurred in February 1933 when Panetta suffered from a double herniotomy and was hospitalized for treatment. He received disability payments during his recovery period, which lasted until April 1933. Throughout these health challenges, Panetta's employment with the railroad remained consistent, indicating a dedicated service to the company.",
