  "biographical_narrative": "Mario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, primarily working in the Cumberland Division. His employment record indicates several instances of disability due to both accidents and sickness. In February 1916, he experienced an accident that led to his total disablement from February 5th to February 14th, during which no wages were allowed. He returned to duty on February 25th after being declared fit by a medical examiner. Panetta's records also show another period of disability due to acute bronchitis in January 1916, indicating he was likely susceptible to respiratory illnesses. His employment spanned at least from early 1916 through September 1922, with documentation showing his residence and payment details during this time.",
