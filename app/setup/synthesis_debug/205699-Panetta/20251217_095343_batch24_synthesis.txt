  "biographical_narrative": "Illario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, employed in Keyser, West Virginia. His employment began before September 1934 when he reported as disabled and ceased compensated service. In 1937, after the passage of the Railroad Retirement Act, Panetta applied for an annuity from the Railroad Retirement Board due to his disability status. Throughout this period, multiple medical examinations were conducted by various doctors to assess his condition and determine eligibility for benefits. The company's Relief Department provided him with advances while his application was processed, which he later had to repay upon receiving his annuity. Panetta\u2019s case highlights the complexities of navigating between railroad relief programs and federal retirement benefits during the early 20th century.",
