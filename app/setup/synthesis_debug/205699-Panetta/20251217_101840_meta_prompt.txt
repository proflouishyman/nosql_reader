His earliest documented injury occurred in March 1906, when he suffered a skull fracture that required hospitalization for several months. After his recovery, he continued to work for the railroad but faced periods of furlough and other administrative challenges. In January 1934, Panetta was furloughed from his position as a laborer in the Car Shops Department, Cumberland Division. Despite these setbacks, he attempted to maintain membership in the Relief Feature of the company's relief department for natural death benefits during his period of unemployment.",

His career with the railroad spanned several years during which he experienced multiple health issues that affected his work. In October 1931, Panetta reported an injury at work involving lifting heavy beds, leading to a right inguinal hernia. Despite this incident, he continued working until October 27th of the same year. A more severe disability occurred in February 1933 when Panetta suffered from a double herniotomy and was hospitalized for treatment. He received disability payments during his recovery period, which lasted until April 1933. Throughout these health challenges, Panetta's employment with the railroad remained consistent, indicating a dedicated service to the company.",

He also suffered from bronchitis that led to disability and subsequent sick leave payments (December 30, 1915 - March 24, 1916). Panetta's employment records indicate he was a laborer on the Cumberland Division at times, suggesting he had multiple roles within the company. His career with B&O Railroad included periods of disability and recovery, reflecting the risks associated with railroad work during this era.",

Later in May of the same year, he returned to duty after being declared fit for work by medical examiners. His records also show that he had another instance of disability due to influenza in late 1916 and early 1917, which again resulted in a period without wages but with benefits provided. Throughout his employment, Panetta was subject to the company's relief department policies regarding sickness and injury.",

Throughout his tenure with the railroad company, Panetta held positions such as Car Ref. Keeper (Car Repairman) in the M.P. Department and Division Cw., and later as a Coach Cleaner in the MO Department and Atlantic Division. He experienced multiple medical issues including an operation on his nose, shoulder strain, and acute bronchitis with nasal obstruction. These health concerns led to periods of disability from which he eventually returned to work after receiving medical clearance.",

In April 1915, he reported strained muscles in his right shoulder and side of the neck after carrying a rail on his shoulder, though this did not result in him reporting off work. Later, in June 1919, Panetta was treated for acute bronchitis and nasal obstruction at Columbus Hospital in New York City, where he underwent surgery to correct deviation of the nasal septum and hypertrophy of the middle turbinate bone. He returned to duty on July 30, 1919. In January 1921, Panetta sustained a laceration to his thumb, which led to another period of disability and subsequent benefits until he was able to return to work in July of that year.",

His employment spanned several decades, with records indicating his active participation from at least the early 1900s to the early 1930s. Throughout his career, Panetta experienced various periods of furlough and disability, including a significant hospitalization in February 1933 following an operation. He was particularly concerned about maintaining his insurance benefits during these times, often writing to the Relief Department to ensure proper deductions from his paychecks or direct payments for his relief dues. His letters reveal a meticulous attention to detail regarding benefit amounts and payment schedules, reflecting both personal financial concerns and a broader context of economic hardship during the Great Depression.",

This led to further health complications, including myalgia lumbalis and cataracts in both eyes, which ultimately rendered him permanently disabled. Panetta's application for a disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935 was processed through multiple medical examinations and administrative reviews, culminating in his receipt of an annuity effective June 24th, 1937.",

This condition was assessed as potentially lasting between four and six weeks but ultimately progressed into a more chronic issue with the onset of cataracts in both eyes by February 1, 1935. By August 6, 1935, Panetta was declared permanently disabled due to his medical conditions.",

Despite these health issues, there is no evidence suggesting his employment was interrupted or terminated due to injury. By 1958, Panetta was still contributing to the Relief Department's fund, indicating ongoing employment with the company.",
