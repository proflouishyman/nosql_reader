  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in Keyser, West Virginia. His career with the railroad spanned several decades, during which he faced multiple health challenges that impacted his employment. In October 1931, Panetta suffered an injury at work, leading to a hernia operation and subsequent disability leave. He was later able to return to duty after recovery. In February 1933, another incident led to a double herniotomy, which required hospitalization and further absence from work until May of the same year. Throughout his tenure with B&O Railroad, Panetta's health issues were closely monitored by medical examiners, who documented his condition and progress in detail.",
