  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. His career with the railroad is marked by several health-related incidents, including a back injury sustained while lifting iron at work on August 31, 1934, which led to his disablement due to myalgia lumbalis. This condition was assessed as potentially lasting between four and six weeks but ultimately progressed into a more chronic issue with the onset of cataracts in both eyes by February 1, 1935. By August 6, 1935, Panetta was declared permanently disabled due to his medical conditions.",
