  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta, a laborer for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, had a career marked by several injuries and medical issues that required ongoing attention from the company's Relief Department. His employment history includes periods of disability due to workplace accidents and health conditions such as hernias. In May 1912, he suffered an injury while working in Keyser, West Virginia, which led to his temporary inability to work. He was later certified fit for duty by medical examiners. By October 1931, Panetta reported another disability but did not lose any time from work. The company provided him with a double truss due to an inguinal hernia that developed while he was on duty in October 1931.",
