  "biographical_narrative": "Harris Panetta was employed as a brakeman by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company during the early 20th century. His career was marked by several incidents involving injuries, including an accident where he sustained a contused left leg after heavy timber fell off his shoulder while on duty at Koppers in Pittsburgh (September 1914). He also suffered from bronchitis that led to disability and subsequent sick leave payments (December 30, 1915 - March 24, 1916). Panetta's employment records indicate he was a laborer on the Cumberland Division at times, suggesting he had multiple roles within the company. His career with B&O Railroad included periods of disability and recovery, reflecting the risks associated with railroad work during this era.",
