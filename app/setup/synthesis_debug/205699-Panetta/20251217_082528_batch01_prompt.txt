Dr Stephens, Med. Ex.
Dear Dr; - Regarding your inquiry in reference to Ilario Vanetta and Ilario Panetta being the one and same person, I beg to say that we have the name Vanetta, which is the way we understood it, and have no record of any one by the name of Panetta. I am sure it means the man whose name we have as Vanetta. You have some idea how hard it is to understand some of these Italian names. Panetta, as you have it, was in the hospital from March third to May fifth, inclusive. This man had an extensive injury to head, face and nose, with fracture of skull.
Yours truly,
HOFFMAN HOSPITAL.
per C. S. Hoffman

SUMMARY:
A letter from Hoffman Hospital (Keyser, WV) to Dr. Stephens, dated June 5, 1906. The letter clarifies that Ilario Vanetta and Ilario Panetta are likely the same person. The hospital only has a record under the name Vanetta, not Panetta. The patient was hospitalized from March 3 to May 5 with major head, face, and nose injuries and a skull fracture.
