  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta, an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, had a career marked by several health-related absences and injuries. His employment began sometime before 1912, as evidenced by his certificate of ability to return to duty dated June 30th, 1912. Throughout his tenure with the railroad company, Panetta held positions such as Car Ref. Keeper (Car Repairman) in the M.P. Department and Division Cw., and later as a Coach Cleaner in the MO Department and Atlantic Division. He experienced multiple medical issues including an operation on his nose, shoulder strain, and acute bronchitis with nasal obstruction. These health concerns led to periods of disability from which he eventually returned to work after receiving medical clearance.",
