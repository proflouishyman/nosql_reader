February 8th, 1938.
Mr. Ernest A. See, Attorney at Law, Keyser, W. Va.
Dear Sir:
Replying to your letter of February 4th, in the case of Mario Panetta, who was employed by this Company as Laborer at Keyser, W. Va., and who reported disabled on September 2nd, 1934. When the Railroad Retirement Act became effective he applied to the Board for an annuity.
Regulation No. 57 of the Relief Department reads as follows:
"All rights to receive benefits shall cease from the date a member ceases to be employed in the service, either temporarily or permanently, except in the cases provided for in Regulations Nos. 19 and 21; upon voluntary withdrawal from membership; upon retirement from active service by reason of the provisions of any old age, pension or retirement law, or similar act, which may have been or shall be enacted or established by the Federal Government, or any State Government, or any governmental agency, (excluding provision for any pension for military or na

SUMMARY:
This is a letter dated February 8, 1938, from a company official to attorney Ernest A. See regarding Mario Panetta, a former company laborer who became disabled in 1934 and later applied for an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. The letter references regulations governing benefit payments and highlights that the Relief Department cannot pay benefits concurrently with an annuity from the Railroad Retirement Board. It details advance payments made to Mr. Panetta while his annuity application was processed, with an agreement that these advances would be repaid. Mr. Panetta was paid $240 in advances and owes an additional $1.95 for a February contribution. The letter urges prompt repayment per his agreement.

Dear Sir:

Re: Illario Pannetta,

Keyser, W. Va.
Your file No. ERK-MIB
205699
MP-Cu.

I wrote you on February 4th, 1938 concerning this matter. Since then I have more information, which may simplify your reply to my letter, if you have not already written it.

As I now understand the situation Mr. Pannetta should refund $211.95 to Mr. J. J. Jenkins, Asst. Treasurer B&O R. R. Co., and that Mr. Pannetta may keep up or retain his natural life benefits by paying a little less than $2.00 a month to the Relief Department of the B&O. Please let me know if this situation is correct. If it is Mr. Pannetta will make his refund promptly.

Respectfully yours,
ERNEST A. SEE.


SUMMARY:
Attorney Ernest A. See writes to Mr. W. M. Kennedy of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. Relief Department regarding the refund owed by Illario Pannetta. See references a previous letter and clarifies that Pannetta should refund $211.95 to the B&O's Assistant Treasurer, J. J. Jenkins, but may retain his life benefits by paying less than $2.00 monthly to the Relief Department. The letter requests confirmation of this arrangement.

Dear Sir:
Mr. Pannetta has asked me to write you concerning the conversation which he has had with Mr. Gurstwite, your medical examiner from Cumberland, and which relates to relief benefits paid him or to which he might be entitled, and also the funds which he is about to receive from the Railroad Retirement Board.
Mr. Pannetta is a member of your Relief Department, number 2056999 as a laborer in the Motive Power Department, Cumberland Division, Class D and 1, and has paid at the rate of $3.45 per month with additional death benefits.
The Railroad Retirement Board has awarded him $32.01 a month, dating back to June 24, 1937, and as Mr. Pannetta and his son-in-law understand, Mr. Gurstwite ordered him to refund back to the Relief Departme

SUMMARY:
The letter, written by attorney Ernest A. See, addresses concerns regarding Illario Pannetta's relief and retirement benefits from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. and the Railroad Retirement Board. The letter clarifies confusion about refunding relief department funds and the possible elimination of death benefits due to new retirement benefits. The attorney advises that the elimination of death benefits and the request for refund may not be correct and that Pannetta cannot receive disability benefits from both the Relief Department and the Railroad Retirement Board for the same period.

WHEELLE -

January 29th, 1938.

Mr. M. E. Lynch,
Director, Claims Service,
Railroad Retirement Board,
Washington, D.C.

My dear Mr. Lynch:

Referring to your notice of the granting of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act to Illario Pannetta, Laborer, Keyser, W. Va., your No. A-2291, obviously the effective date, as shown, is incorrect - September 1st, 1934, as we, of course, know that neither the 1935 Act nor the amendment thereto was effective before June 1st, 1936. The typist has evidently confused the date of last service, which was September 1st, 1934, with the effective date.

May I ask, therefore, that you either send me revised form, or advise the effective date of this annuity so that I may insert the correct date in the form that I have.

Very respectfully,

SUMMARY:
The letter addresses an error in the effective date of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act for Illario Pannetta. The letter notes a confusion between the date of last service and the effective date, asking for confirmation or correction to update records appropriately.
