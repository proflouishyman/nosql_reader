His employment records indicate he suffered an injury in March 1906, which caused him to be out of work until May 7th of that year when he returned to duty. In early 1934, Panetta experienced another disruption in his career, as evidenced by a furlough on April 13th and subsequent return to work on March 21st. Throughout the years, Panetta maintained membership in the company's mutual death benefits program, requiring regular contributions even during periods of non-employment.",
