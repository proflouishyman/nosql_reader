  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was a laborer employed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (B&O R.R. Co.) in West Virginia during the early 20th century. His employment history with B&O is documented from around 1930, when he applied for full membership in the Relief Feature of the company's Relief Department. As a laborer, Panetta was likely involved in various manual tasks essential to railroad operations such as track maintenance and construction projects. He designated his wife Teresa Panetta as the primary beneficiary of any death benefits accruing from his membership in the Relief Feature, with his daughter Nellie Demasi named as the contingent beneficiary. The records indicate that Panetta maintained a consistent employment status within B&O until at least 1932 when he updated his beneficiary designations.",
