Mr. Ilario Zanetta
66 Torroni St.
Keyser, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

While under the original Railroad Retirement Act of 1935, you could not qualify for an annuity, I am glad to report that under the amendment of the Act recently passed by Congress and signed by the President on June 24, 1937, you are eligible as a disabled railroad employee for such annuity as your years of service up to thirty and your average earnings will produce; as the annuity will doubtless exceed the benefits you are receiving from the Relief Department, it will be greatly to your advantage to apply for an annuity promptly. Forms Nos. AA-1, AA-1 duplicate and 38 of the Railroad Retirement Board, to be used in making application for the annuity if you have not already filed an application with the Board, are attached; when completed, they should be sent direct to the Railroad Retirement Board, whose address is Washington, D.

The letter describes application steps, continued interim benefits, and the need to refund overlapping benefits if an annuity is granted. It outlines relevant regulations prohibiting dual benefits from the Relief Department and railroad pensions, and provides instructions regarding required forms and documentation.
