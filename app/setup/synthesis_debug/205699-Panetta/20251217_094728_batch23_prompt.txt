Mr. Hardie Pancost,
60 Vernon Ave.,
Keyser, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

On July 10th, you paid 1.90 to the Agent at Keyser and receipt #225085 was issued to show payment of contributions for the month of August. As your regular monthly rate is 1.95, the deposit was five cents short of the amount necessary to cover one month's contributions.
You should, therefore, immediately deposit five cents additional to adjust your account to August 31st and beginning on or before September 1st payments should be at the rate of 1.95 monthly.

Very respectfully,

CY: Mr. V. D. Twiggs
Agent,
Keyser, W. Va.

SUMMARY:
This is a letter dated August 13, 1942, addressed to Mr. Hardie Pancost in Keyser, West Virginia, notifying him that his recent payment was five cents short of the required monthly contribution. He is advised to deposit the difference and is reminded of the updated monthly rate.

Dear Sir:

Your letter of the 8th was received, and I think I understand the case clearly. I knew that Mr. Panetta could not receive benefits from both your Relief Department and from the Railroad Retirement Act.

I was a little concerned about his natural death benefits.

I feel confident that they will reimburse you to the amount of $210.00 and will continue his natural benefits of $1.95.

Very truly yours,

ERNEST A. SEE
