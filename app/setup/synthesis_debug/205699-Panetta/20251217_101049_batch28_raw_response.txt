  "biographical_narrative": "Mario Panetta began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a laborer in the Motive Power Department, Cumberland Division around the early 1900s. His application for full membership in the Relief Feature was dated December 11, 1918, indicating he had been working for the company for some time by then. Panetta's employment records show that he continued to work for the railroad into the mid-20th century. In May of 1935, a medical examination revealed that he was suffering from lumbar myalgia and beginning cataracts in both eyes. Despite these health issues, there is no evidence suggesting his employment was interrupted or terminated due to injury. By 1958, Panetta was still contributing to the Relief Department's fund, indicating ongoing employment with the company.",
