His career spanned several years from at least early 1930s to mid-1950s, during which he experienced periods of disability due to rheumatism affecting his legs, back, and shoulders. He was furloughed multiple times, including in June 1933 and May-July 1953, when he resumed work for a short period before being furloughed again. Panetta maintained communication with the company regarding contributions and benefits during periods of disability or absence from work.",
