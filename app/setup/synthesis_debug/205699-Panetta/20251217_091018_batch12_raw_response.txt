  "biographical_narrative": "Lewis Panetta was employed as a laborer by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working in various capacities within different divisions. His career spanned at least from 1910 through 1917, with notable periods of disablement due to sickness. In January 1916, he experienced a prolonged period of disability that lasted until early 1917. He was also involved in a strike in July 1917 but was reinstated shortly thereafter. Throughout his career, Panetta faced several health issues, including an influenza episode and other unspecified sicknesses, which required medical attention and certification from the company's Relief Department.",
