  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta, born August 1, 1875, worked for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad as a laborer from at least February 1930 until his resignation due to disability. His career with the railroad was marked by several periods of sickness and injury, including an incident in September 1934 where he sprained his back on duty while lifting heavy objects. This led to further health complications, including myalgia lumbalis and cataracts in both eyes, which ultimately rendered him permanently disabled. Panetta's application for a disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935 was processed through multiple medical examinations and administrative reviews, culminating in his receipt of an annuity effective June 24th, 1937.",
