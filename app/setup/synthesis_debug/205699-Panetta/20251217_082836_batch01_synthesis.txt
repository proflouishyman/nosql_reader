  "biographical_narrative": "Ilario Panetta was an employee of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company who had a varied career marked by both injuries and changes in employment status. His earliest documented injury occurred in March 1906, when he suffered a skull fracture that required hospitalization for several months. After his recovery, he continued to work for the railroad but faced periods of furlough and other administrative challenges. In January 1934, Panetta was furloughed from his position as a laborer in the Car Shops Department, Cumberland Division. Despite these setbacks, he attempted to maintain membership in the Relief Feature of the company's relief department for natural death benefits during his period of unemployment.",
