  "biographical_narrative": "Mario Panetta was a laborer employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. His employment records indicate he worked for the company from at least 1916, with multiple instances of disability due to illness recorded during that year. In March and April of 1916, Panetta was disabled by pneumonia, which led to a period where his wages were not allowed and benefits were paid out. Later in May of the same year, he returned to duty after being declared fit for work by medical examiners. His records also show that he had another instance of disability due to influenza in late 1916 and early 1917, which again resulted in a period without wages but with benefits provided. Throughout his employment, Panetta was subject to the company's relief department policies regarding sickness and injury.",
