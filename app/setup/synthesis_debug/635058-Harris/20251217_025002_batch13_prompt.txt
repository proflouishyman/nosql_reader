Dr. Roscoe Stotts,
Kenova,
W. Va.

Dear Doctor:

Mr. Charley Harris, Fireman Wheeling Division, who was rejected for employment on October 7th, 1939, upon return from furlough because of the existence of an aortic systolic murmur, has requested some information regarding his physical condition and mentions the fact that you are located close to his home in Kenova, and I assume that he intends to consult you.

After his rejection for employment he was further examined in Baltimore by our Diagnostic Unit in the University Hospital and his general physical condition was found to be satisfactory with the exception of a chronic valvular myocarditis and an aortic stenosis. You, of course, appreciate the fact that this particular type of valvular disease is quite a serious one, and there is a possibility of his sudden and for that reason we can not consistently consider him safe in engine service.

Very truly yours,

Medical & Surgical Director.

Mr. A. R. Carver,
Superintendent,
Wheeling, W. Va.

Dear Sir:-

Referring to your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the case of Charley Harris, Fireman, Wheeling Division, who as reported in my letter of December 14th, 1939, was examined by our consulting physicians in Baltimore, and found to have valvular heart trouble, would advise that he has apparently made application for an annuity and the Railroad Retirement Board has requested that his service record be furnished, which is now being developed through proper channels.

Obviously you appreciate the fact that since he was rejected for membership in the Relief Department upon recall from furlough, because of his physical condition, and the fact that he was over age limit for membership, he is not entitled to Relief Department benefits. I have observed that he wrote Superintendent Kennedy on the 17th instant making some inquiry in this direction, and I am confident Mr. Kennedy

Baltimore, Md. Dec. 14th, 1939.

Mr. A. R. Carver,
Superintendent,
Wheeling, W. Va.

Dear Sir:-

Referring further to your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the physical condition of Charley Harris, furloughed Fireman, who upon examination on October 7th, 1939 by Dr. HIMAL, was found to have valvular heart disease, would advise that he has been examined by our consulting physicians in Baltimore, and the existence of valvular heart trouble has been confirmed.

Our Medical Consultant in summarizing the opinion states “there does not seem to be any impairment of his physical ability, and I see no reason why he should not be permitted to work as a Fireman although, of course, in any case of aortic stenosis (the type of valvular trouble that Mr. Harris has) – parentheses mine – there may be the possibility of a sudden exodus.”

This particular type of valvular heart disease is one that is more prone to result in sudden death than any other form of valvular heart disease,

Carver, addresses the medical evaluation of Charley Harris, a furloughed Fireman diagnosed with valvular heart disease.
