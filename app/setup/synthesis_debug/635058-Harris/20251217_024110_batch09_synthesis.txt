  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris was a fireman for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. He began his career with the company but faced significant challenges due to health issues. In March of 1937, he was furloughed from service, likely due to medical reasons or other circumstances. Harris attempted to return to duty in October 1939 when he was recalled by the company. However, upon returning, his application for new membership and re-employment was rejected after a medical examination revealed that he did not meet the necessary health standards required for firemen. This rejection led to legal disputes over benefits and contributions made during his employment tenure.",
