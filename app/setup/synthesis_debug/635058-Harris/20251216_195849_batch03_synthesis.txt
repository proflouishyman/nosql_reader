  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris, a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, began his career with the company sometime before 1927. His employment records indicate several instances of disability due to illness, particularly influenza, which affected his work in early 1919 and again in 1927. Harris faced administrative challenges regarding the correct spelling of his name and discrepancies between different applications for membership. He was involved in a legal dispute against the railroad company in 1941, suggesting significant dissatisfaction with his treatment or working conditions.",
