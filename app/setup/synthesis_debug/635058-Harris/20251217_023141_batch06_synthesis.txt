  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. His career spanned several decades and included notable periods of illness and injury that required medical attention and compensation through the company's relief department. Harris experienced at least two significant disabilities: one due to influenza in early 1919, which lasted from February 27th to March 6th, and another period of disability reported in late 1926 or early 1927, where he was unable to work for several days. Throughout his career, Harris's employment records reflect a need for clarification regarding the correct spelling of his first name, which alternated between 'Charley' and 'Charles.' Despite these administrative issues, Harris maintained his position as a fireman in various departments and divisions across West Virginia.",
