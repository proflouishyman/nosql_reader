  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris was a fireman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century. He began his career as a fireman, working under various divisions and departments within the railroad system. On June 11, 1928, Harris suffered an injury to his right foot when it was caught between the apron and step of the cab during a collision with an automobile at Apple Grove, West Virginia. This incident led to several days of disability and required medical attention from Dr. Funk and Dr. Stotts. Despite the severity of the accident, Harris returned to duty on June 17, 1928, after receiving appropriate treatment and clearance from his medical examiner.",
