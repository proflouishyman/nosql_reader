  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris, born in 1893, began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman in an unspecified year prior to November 1939. His employment spanned several years during which he contributed significantly to the company's insurance fund. In October or early November of 1939, Harris suffered an injury that led to his total disability and subsequent retirement from service on December 19, 1939. Throughout his tenure with B&O Railroad, Harris held a position in the Wheeling Division. His case highlights the complexities involved in workers' compensation claims and the role of medical examinations in determining eligibility for benefits.",
