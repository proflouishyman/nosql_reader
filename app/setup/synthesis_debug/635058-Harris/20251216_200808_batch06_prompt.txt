Dr. Milholland: 
Dear Sir; 
I would like to have a report of your examination on my physical condition, what my condition is, and what you would advise for me. Is there a Dr. in Huntington W.

Dr. Stotts of Kenova is close to my home. Have you heard from the R.R. Pension Board of Washington D.C. in regard to my case. I filed application forms with them recently for my annuity, on my physical disability, and I am very badly in need financially. Would appreciate this being given your prompt attention! 
Very Respectfully yours

Mr. A. R. Carver,
Superintendent,
Wheeling, W. Va.

Dear Sir:-

Referring further to your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the physical condition of Charley Harris, furloughed Fireman, who upon examination on October 7th, 1939 by Dr. HIMAL, was found to have valvular heart disease, would advise that he has been examined by our consulting physicians in Baltimore, and the existence of valvular heart trouble has been confirmed.

Our Medical Consultant in summarizing the opinion states “there does not seem to be any impairment of his physical ability, and I see no reason why he should not be permitted to work as a Fireman although, of course, in any case of aortic stenosis (the type of valvular trouble that Mr. Harris has) – parentheses mine – there may be the possibility of a sudden exodus.”

This particular type of valvular heart disease is one that is more prone to result in sudden death than any other form of valvular heart disease,

SUMMARY:
A letter from the Medical & Surgical Director, dated December 14, 1939, to Mr. A. R. Carver, addresses the medical evaluation of Charley Harris, a furloughed Fireman diagnosed with valvular heart disease. The letter confirms the diagnosis via consulting physicians and summarizes that while Harris may not be physically impaired for work as a Fireman, the specific heart condition (aortic stenosis) entails a risk of sudden death.

#4 - Charley Harris
COMMENT: This patient, a fireman, was sent in for examination because on the 7th October '39 upon routine examination an aortic systolic murmur was discovered.
Diagnosis: Chronic Valvular Myocarditis; Aortic Stenosis; Functional Capacity Impaired (I).
The physical examination does not show any enlargement of the heart but does reveal a sufficient amount of physical findings to indicate the presence of aortic stenosis. There does not seem to be any impairment of his physical ability, and I see no reason why he should not be permitted to work as a fireman although, of course, in any case of aortic stenosis there may be the possibility of a sudden exodus.
GL:B Carroll Lockard, M. D.

SUMMARY:
The document is a medical report for Charley Harris, a fireman, who was examined after a routine checkup discovered an aortic systolic murmur. Diagnosed with chronic valvular myocarditis and aortic stenosis with no impairment of physical ability detected.

Dr. Nimal:-

Replying to yours, under date of October 25th, 1939, regarding Charley Harris, who was rejected by you, on October 7th, last, when returning from a furlough, being rejected on account of his age and also the fact that he has an aortic systolic murmur, I do not feel he should be employed in train service, without membership, as any man with a serious heart condition of this character cannot be considered a safe employe in train service.

If the Division Superintendent decides to employ him, irrespective of the above, he should be sent to Baltimore for examination by our Diagnostic Unit, before he is permitted to go to work.

E. V. Milholand.

EM/R

SUMMARY:
This letter addresses the employment status of Charley Harris, who was previously rejected for employment due to age and a serious heart condition (aortic systolic murmur). The letter advises against employing him in train service. If employment is insisted upon by the Division Superintendent, a medical examination in Baltimore is recommended before he can begin work.

Dear Doctor Milholland:-
Parkersburg, W. Va.
October 25, 1939
On October 7th I examined Charley Harris Fireman Wheeling division for return to duty from furlough, he was over the age limit for new membership and had been out of service too long to reinstate. The Form 60 was marked rejected for membership O. A. L. and the rejection or acceptance for employment was not marked as in addition to his age disqualification he was found to have an aortic systolic murmur.

The division Accountant, Mr. W. S. Hopkins at Wheeling has returned the form 60 to me to be marked concerning employment and I have written to him that the matter has been referred to you and that you would advise him direct. As there were no signs of any decompensation it may be safe for him to be employed under observation without benefit of insurance, however aortic lesions for men on engines is a matter I would rather not decide.

Very respectfully

SUMMARY:
A medical director reports on the status of Charley Harris, a fireman from Wheeling division, who was found medically and administratively ineligible for reinstatement to duty after furlough due to age limit, prolonged absence, and an aortic systolic murmur. The decision on his employment status is referred for further review.
