Mr. Charley Harris,
811 Hill Street,
Ceredo, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

Your letter of February 19, addressed to Dr. Milholland, has been referred to me, in which you advise that Dr. Stott has informed you that any medical assistance given you will be upon your responsibility, and ask whether it is this Department's intention to provide such treatment as may be required.

Even in instances of employees who are members of the Relief Department in good standing, there is no provision in the Relief Department regulations under which the Department assumes any responsibility whatever for the payment of any physicians or other charges that might accrue in connection with a sickness disability occurring to the member. Provision is made only for the furnishing of surgical care in the event a member is injured while in the discharge of his duty for the Company. Your disability is purely one of sickness, and in such a case, the responsibility for medical attention would

I went to see Dr Roscoe Stotts at Kenova, W. Va., as advised by you. Dr Stotts said that his letter from you, did not state any assistance, and that whatever medical assistance he gave me I would have to be responsible for.

What are your intentions regarding my case? I am entitled to assistance from the Relief Department, for while I was working they took $5.00 a month out of my wages for sick relief and the last time I marked up they would not let me in because I was 46 years of age - now that I am disabled and in need of assistance it is only right that I should have assistance.

OCR TEXT:
application for an annuity and the Railroad Retirement Board has requested that his service record be furnished, which is now being developed through proper channels.

"Obviously you appreciate the fact that since he was rejected for membership in the Relief Department upon recall from furlough, because of his physical condition, and the fact that he was over age limit for membership, he is not entitled to Relief Department benefits. I have observed that he wrote Superintendent Kennedy on the 17th instant making some inquiry in this direction and I am confident Mr. Kennedy will explain the situation to him."

You will note he stated he was confident that you would write Mr. Harris, replying to his letter of January 17th, explaining the situation to him. Has this been done and can you advise if the necessary information has been furnished the Railroad Retirement Board as to Mr. Harris' physical condition in connection with his application for annuity on the basis of total disability.
