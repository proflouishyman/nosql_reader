December 11, 1940

Mr. W. H. Kennedy, Superintendent,
Baltimore & Ohio Railway Company,
Baltimore, Maryland,

Dear Sir:

I am in receipt of yours of the 28th concerning the matter of Charley Harris. Mr. Harris informs me that the premiums upon this insurance, at least $500.00 thereof, were deducted from his pay up to the time he was relieved. This being so it would seem immaterial whether he made any new application.

I should be pleased to know whether you adhere to the position stated in your letter.

Yours very truly,
[signature]

Mr. Connor Hall,
Attorney and Counselor at Law,
202 First Huntington Arcade,
Huntington, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

Your letter of November 21st has been received, together with affidavit signed by Mr. Charley Harris. Mr. Harris previously had his case in the hands of another attorney at Huntington, W. Va., and for your information I am quoting a letter written to the attorney under date of April 16th, 1940, which I think explains the conditions in this case:

"I have noted your letter of April 11 concerning Mr. Charles Harris, known to us as Charley Harris, formerly employed as a Fireman.

Under the Relief Department contract of membership, benefits are payable only during such period as a member in good standing is totally disabled by sickness or injury to perform any work. On the other hand, for employees in train and engine service, there is a certain physical standard that must be met if the employee is to remain in the service. A defect in an emplo

SUMMARY:
This letter, dated November 28, 1940, is addressed to attorney Connor Hall and regards the status of Charley Harris's membership and benefits under a Relief Department contract. The letter explains that Harris, a former fireman, was found not totally disabled but unfit for his specific job after a medical exam. As a result, his benefits and membership in the relief program were not revived because he did not fulfill the requirements during his re-employment period.
