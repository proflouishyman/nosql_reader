Asst. R. F. of E.

Re: Disablement of Charley Harris, your form 5 number 99074.

Please inform the above member that we have this date closed the case of his disablement handled under the above form 5.

On Feb 17th he promised to secure a certificate from his attending physician, we believe that we have allowed him more than sufficient time to have procured it, and as it has never been received at this office, we are consequently making no recommendation for benefits.

Dr. W. A. Funk

Dr. W. A. Funk,

Referring to our conversation of March 9th, in regard to Fireman C. Harris. On the morning of the 29th of February I find that Harris marked off but nothing was said as to his being sick. The previous morning he had missed a call for Kenova and I had him in the office. He did not look sick then, nor did he look sick that afternoon at the Co-operative meeting. Understand that he intends to resume duty next week if possible and I am attaching a form 5 putting him on the relief effective February 29th. Possibly you can develope the exact date he had to have the doctor when you call to see him.
