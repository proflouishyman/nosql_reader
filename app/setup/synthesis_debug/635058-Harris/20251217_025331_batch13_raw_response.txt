  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris was a fireman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company's Wheeling Division. His career with the railroad began sometime before 1939, as evidenced by his membership in the Relief Department since 1922 and his contributions to it. In October 1939, Harris faced medical scrutiny after returning from furlough due to an aortic systolic murmur detected upon examination, which led to further diagnosis of chronic valvular myocarditis and aortic stenosis. These conditions rendered him unfit for engine service due to the risk of sudden death associated with his heart condition. Despite this, Harris sought assistance through various means, including applying for annuity benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board and requesting support from the railroad's Relief Department, given his inability to work and financial distress.",
