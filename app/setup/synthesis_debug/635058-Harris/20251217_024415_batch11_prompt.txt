Mr. Jean F. Smith,
Attorney and Counselor at Law,
Room 8-9, Miller Building,
423½ Ninth Street,
Huntington, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

I have noted your letter of April 11 concerning Mr. Charles Harris, known to us as Charley Harris, formerly employed as a fireman.

Under the Relief Department contract of membership, benefits are payable only during such period as a member in good standing is totally disabled by sickness or injury to perform any work. On the other hand, for employees in train and engine service, there is a certain physical standard that must be met if the employee is to remain in the service. A defect in an employee's physical condition, which would render him unsafe in train and engine service, need not be totally disabling.

When Mr. Harris was recalled to duty and underwent the necessary examination to determine his fitness for service, it was found that he was suffering from a condition which disqualified him under the physical standards s

SUMMARY:
A letter dated April 16, 1940, is sent to attorney Jean F. Smith regarding Mr. Charles Harris (Charley Harris), a former fireman. The letter discusses Harris's membership status and eligibility for benefits under the Relief Department contract. Harris was found physically unfit for his former position but not totally disabled, as he could potentially work other jobs. His membership was not revived since there is no record of payment for required contributions following his recall to duty.

Dear Mr. Kennedy:

IN RE: HGS:WLJ 635058

Mr. Charles Harris of 811 Hill Street, Ceredo, West Virginia has placed his claim against the Baltimore & Ohio Relief Department in my hands for a settlement and I would like to take this matter up with you and see what kind of a settlement can be made in this claim as he seems to be permanently injured, and from the advise of your physician that he will not be able to work again.

I would like to discuss this matter over with you and see whether or not we can arrive at a settlement before bringing a suit.

Awaiting an early reply, I remain,

Yours very truly,
Jean F. Smith

SUMMARY:
This letter from attorney Jean F. Smith to claim agent W. L. Kennedy concerns a settlement claim for Charles Harris, who is apparently permanently injured and unable to work. The attorney requests a discussion to potentially settle the matter before pursuing legal action.

OCR TEXT:
HCS:WLJ  April 11, 1940  MEMORANDUM  Charley Harris was employed as fireman, was furloughed March 22, 1937, and resumed duty on first call for services on October 10, 1939. He resumed duty within three years from the date of his original furlough, and regardless of physical condition, had he agreed to pay natural death contributions during the period he was out, he would have been eligible to automatic restoration to membership, but so far as I can determine, no one approached him on the subject of paying the natural death contributions, but instead, Form 60 was issued, and he was sent to the Medical Examiner for examination on October 7, 1939. Dr. Tinsley rejected him, as he was over age, and was suffering from an aortic systolic murmur, marking Form 60 “Rejected for membership,” but made no decision as to eligibility for employment, leaving that question for Dr. Millholland to decide.  Had Mr. Harris resumed duty on October 10, 1939, and not reported at all to the Medical Examiner, u
... [truncated for length]

SUMMARY:
The memorandum discusses the employment and membership status of Charley Harris, a fireman who was furloughed and later resumed duty. Due to missed contributions and a subsequent medical rejection for membership (due to age and health), his eligibility for certain employee benefits and membership was negatively affected. The memo analyzes the implications of his handling by division officials and the potential consequences for benefit claims. Harris's application to the Railroad Retirement Board was denied due to insufficient service.

Am now in receipt of another letter from Mr. Harris under date of April 4th reading as follows:

"I received a letter today from the Railroad Retirement Board, regarding my application for annuity on my physical disability and they said I did not have enough service to be eligible for any annuity.

As long as I was working for the Railroad Co. I paid into the Relief Department but when I was called into service October 7, 1939, I was 46 years old and was refused relief then taken out of service on November 10th, 1939, being disabled for service.

Under the circumstances I am entitled to compensation or a settlement of some kind and I am writing to you to find out what the Railroad Co. wishes to do concerning

Dear Sir:
Referring to your letter to me dated March 20th, HCS-WJ-635058 in connection with my examination of Charles Harris, Fireman, Wheeling on October 7, 1939.
I have had a talk with the secretary to the Train Master located here and find that it was he who prepared Form 60 for Harris and on his Part 1 of the Form 60 is the notation “Last worked May 1937”. He states that most of those who were calling for Forms 60 for reemployment at that time were able only to approximate the time that they last worked, and it was his practice to enter on the Form 60 their statement and it then became my responsibility to question the employee to determine if he should be given reexamination, biennial, only for reemployment and if authorization for collection for a

SUMMARY:
The document is a letter from E.V. Milholland, M.D., Medical and Surgical Director for The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company's Relief Department, addressed to Superintendent W.M. Kennedy. The letter discusses details related to the examination and reemployment status of Charles Harris, a fireman from Wheeling. Key points include Harris's last employment date, the practices around employment forms and reexaminations, and that Harris was out of service too long to be reinstated, as verified by both Harris's statement and supporting records. The matter involves various forms, reexamination criteria, and the handling of employee records.

Dr. Nimm:

I again have before me the case of Charley Harris, in connection with which I wrote you on March 15.

There is one feature of this case that I am particularly anxious to clear up. I presume the employing officers are familiar with the Operating Committee's decision that men restored to service after furlough within three years are eligible to restoration to membership, regardless of age or physical condition, provided they resume duty on after call, and have paid, or agree to pay, natural death contributions covering the period of temporary absence.

It is hard to understand why Mr. Harris was sent to you with a form 60, particularly as he is over the age limit to acquire membership. I wish you would talk to his immediate employing officer and determine whether or not Mr. Harris made any mention to him, when he was recalled to service, concerning his Relief Department membership, stating particularly whether he said that he did not want to pay up his natural

SUMMARY:
A letter dated March 20, 1940, from W. M. Kennedy addresses Dr. Nimm regarding Charley Harris's eligibility for restoration to membership after a furlough. Kennedy requests clarification about Harris's intentions and actions concerning the payment of natural death contributions to revive his insurance and requests that Dr. Nimm confer with Harris's employing officer.

Dr. Nimai:

I have read your letter of October 25, 1939 to Dr. Milholland, in the case of Charley Harris, fireman, who was returning to duty after furlough of July 11, 1937, or within 5 years, in which I note your statement that he was over the age limit for new membership, and had been out of service too long for automatic restoration to membership.

As a matter of fact, if Mr. Harris was resuming duty on the first call within a period of 5 years from the date of his original furlough, he was eligible to automatic restoration to membership, regardless of age or physical condition. See in this connection circular letter No. 607 dated June 15, 1939.

Of course, if Mr. Harris' physical condition was such that he was unsafe in engine service, that was a matter for you to immediately report to Dr. Milholland for necessary action.

W. M. Kennedy


SUMMARY:
The document is a letter dated March 15, 1940, addressing a case regarding Charley Harris, a fireman returning to duty after being on furlough. The letter clarifies the rules for automatic restoration to membership for returning employees, stating that Harris was eligible for automatic restoration if resuming duty within five years, regardless of age or physical condition. However, if Harris was unfit for service, it should be reported for further action.
