  "biographical_narrative": "Charles Harris began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company as a fireman. Over time, he was promoted to foreman, indicating a significant rise through the ranks. Throughout his tenure, Harris experienced several periods of disability due to sickness and injury, which required medical examinations and certificates of ability before returning to duty. His employment spanned from at least 1923 until 1935, with notable absences for health reasons. Despite these interruptions, he maintained a steady career in the railroad industry.",
