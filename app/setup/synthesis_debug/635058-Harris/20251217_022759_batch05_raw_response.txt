  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris began his railroad career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in various capacities. He worked as a fireman and drayman across different divisions including Parkersburg, W.Va., Wheeling, and Benwood. His employment was marked by periods of disablement due to sickness and occasional lapses or withdrawals from union membership. Harris faced multiple examinations for medical clearance and re-employment after absences. Despite the challenges, he continued his service with the railroad until at least 1936.",
