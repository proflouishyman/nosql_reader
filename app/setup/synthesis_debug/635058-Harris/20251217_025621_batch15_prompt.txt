OCR TEXT:
Certz. No. 635058
Baltimore, Md. October 31st, 1939.

Dr. Nimal:-

Replying to yours, under date of October 25th, 1939, regarding Charley Harris, who was rejected by you, on October 7th, last, when returning from a furlough, being rejected on account of his age and also the fact that he has an aortic systolic murmur, I do not feel he should be employed in train service, without membership, as any man with a serious heart condition of this character cannot be considered a safe employe in train service.

If the Division Superintendent decides to employ him, irrespective of the above, he should be sent to Baltimore for examination by our Diagnostic Unit, before he is permitted to go to work.

E. V. Milholand.

EM/R

SUMMARY:
This letter addresses the employment status of Charley Harris, who was previously rejected for employment due to age and a serious heart condition (aortic systolic murmur). The letter advises against employing him in train service. If employment is insisted upon by the Division Superintendent, a medical examination in Baltimore is recommended before he can begin work.

Dr. E. V. Milholland
Medical and Surgical Director
Dear Doctor Milholland:-
Parkersburg, W. Va.
October 25, 1939
On October 7th I examined Charley Harris Fireman Wheeling division for return to duty from furlough, he was over the age limit for new membership and had been out of service too long to reinstate. The Form 60 was marked rejected for membership O. A. L. and the rejection or acceptance for employment was not marked as in addition to his age disqualification he was found to have an aortic systolic murmur.

The division Accountant, Mr. W. S. Hopkins at Wheeling has returned the form 60 to me to be marked concerning employment and I have written to him that the matter has been referred to you and that you would advise him direct. As there were no signs of any decompensation it may be safe for him to be employed under observation without benefit of insurance, however aortic lesions for men on engines is a matter I would rather not decide.

Very respectfully
(signature)

SUMMARY:
A medical director reports on the status of Charley Harris, a fireman from Wheeling division, who was found medically and administratively ineligible for reinstatement to duty after furlough due to age limit, prolonged absence, and an aortic systolic murmur. The decision on his employment status is referred for further review.
