  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, working primarily on the Wheeling Division. His career spanned several decades and included periods of furlough due to medical conditions. In October 1939, Harris was found to have valvular heart disease during a routine examination, which led to his furlough and subsequent medical evaluations. Despite these health issues, he sought to continue working as a fireman but faced significant challenges due to the risks associated with his condition. His application for membership in the Relief Feature of the company's Relief Department reflects his desire for support and insurance benefits. Harris was also seeking assistance from the Railroad Pension Board after being rejected by the Relief Department due to age limits.",
