  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris began his career with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early 20th century, initially working as a Fireman on the Wheeling Division and later transitioning to roles such as Section Laborer. His employment record spans several decades, from at least 1920 through the mid-1930s. Harris was involved with the company's Relief Department, securing membership for himself in various capacities throughout his career. He faced a furlough on July 14, 1930, but returned to service after obtaining medical clearance and completing necessary examinations. His health status remained a focus of attention, as evidenced by multiple physical examination records that confirmed his fitness for duty.",
