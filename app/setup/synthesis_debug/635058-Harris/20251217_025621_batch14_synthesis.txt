  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, working both freight and passenger trains. He began his career with the railroad at an unspecified date but had been serving as a fireman by October 1939 when he underwent a routine medical examination that revealed an aortic systolic murmur. This led to further examinations in November of the same year, during which Harris was found to have chronic valvular myocarditis and aortic stenosis. Despite these conditions, his physical ability remained unimpaired according to Dr. Carroll Lockard's assessment, allowing him to continue working as a fireman without restriction. His employment with the railroad is marked by this medical episode but lacks other significant events such as promotions or disputes.",
