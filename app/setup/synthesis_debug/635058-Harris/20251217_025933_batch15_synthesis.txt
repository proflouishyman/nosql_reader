  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris, a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, began his career around the early 20th century. His employment was marked by medical scrutiny due to an aortic systolic murmur detected during routine examinations. Despite these health concerns, he sought full membership in the Relief Department of the railroad's relief feature on October 7, 1939, indicating his commitment to continuing his service. Harris faced administrative hurdles and medical evaluations that required careful management by both himself and the company\u2019s medical staff. His case highlights the challenges of maintaining employment with a significant health condition during an era when such conditions could severely impact one's ability to work in physically demanding jobs.",
