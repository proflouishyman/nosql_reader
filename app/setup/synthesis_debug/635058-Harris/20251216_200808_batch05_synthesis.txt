  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris, a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, had a career marked by periods of service and furlough. He was initially employed as a fireman but was furloughed on March 22, 1937, due to economic conditions or company policy. Harris resumed his duties in October 10, 1939, after being recalled from furlough within the three-year eligibility period for automatic restoration of membership benefits. However, he faced medical challenges that led to his rejection by the Medical Examiner on October 7, 1939, due to an aortic systolic murmur and chronic valvular myocarditis. His inability to work was further confirmed by additional examinations in Baltimore, where he was found to have serious heart conditions that rendered him unsafe for engine service. Harris sought financial assistance and annuity benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board but faced difficulties due to his age and medical condition.",
