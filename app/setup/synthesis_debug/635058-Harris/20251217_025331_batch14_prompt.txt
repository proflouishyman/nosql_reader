#4 - Charley Harris
COMMENT: This patient, a fireman, was sent in for examination because on the 7th October '39 upon routine examination an aortic systolic murmur was discovered.
Diagnosis: Chronic Valvular Myocarditis; Aortic Stenosis; Functional Capacity Impaired (I).
The physical examination does not show any enlargement of the heart but does reveal a sufficient amount of physical findings to indicate the presence of aortic stenosis. There does not seem to be any impairment of his physical ability, and I see no reason why he should not be permitted to work as a fireman although, of course, in any case of aortic stenosis there may be the possibility of a sudden exodus.
GL:B Carroll Lockard, M. D.

SUMMARY:
The document is a medical report for Charley Harris, a fireman, who was examined after a routine checkup discovered an aortic systolic murmur. Diagnosed with chronic valvular myocarditis and aortic stenosis with no impairment of physical ability detected. The doctor recommends no restriction for fireman duties, but notes the risks associated with aortic stenosis.
