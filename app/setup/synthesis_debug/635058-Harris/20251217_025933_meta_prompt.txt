His career with the railroad appears to have been marked by periods of illness and injury, which led to several instances where he required medical attention and relief from work duties. In 1927, Harris suffered from influenza that incapacitated him for nearly three weeks, during which time he was placed on relief status. He also faced administrative challenges when he failed to provide a necessary physician's certificate, leading to the closure of his case without any recommendation for benefits. Later in life, Harris filed a lawsuit against the railroad company in 1941, alleging that he had suffered significant bodily injuries and mental anguish due to his work, which impaired his ability to earn a livelihood.",

His career with the railroad began sometime before 1939, as evidenced by his membership in the Relief Department since 1922 and his contributions to it. In October 1939, Harris faced medical scrutiny after returning from furlough due to an aortic systolic murmur detected upon examination, which led to further diagnosis of chronic valvular myocarditis and aortic stenosis. These conditions rendered him unfit for engine service due to the risk of sudden death associated with his heart condition. Despite this, Harris sought assistance through various means, including applying for annuity benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board and requesting support from the railroad's Relief Department, given his inability to work and financial distress.",
