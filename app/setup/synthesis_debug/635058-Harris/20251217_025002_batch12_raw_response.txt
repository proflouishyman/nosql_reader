He began his career with the company at an unspecified date before October 7, 1939, when he was examined and found to have an aortic murmur, leading to his rejection from further service due to physical disability. Harris had been contributing to the Relief Department's sick benefit fund for twelve years but never drew benefits until he became disabled in late 1939 at age 46. He sought assistance from both the company and the Railroad Retirement Board, facing challenges in obtaining medical support and financial aid due to his condition.",
