  "biographical_narrative": "Charley Harris was a fireman employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in the early to mid-20th century. His career with the railroad appears to have been marked by periods of illness and injury, which led to several instances where he required medical attention and relief from work duties. In 1927, Harris suffered from influenza that incapacitated him for nearly three weeks, during which time he was placed on relief status. He also faced administrative challenges when he failed to provide a necessary physician's certificate, leading to the closure of his case without any recommendation for benefits. Later in life, Harris filed a lawsuit against the railroad company in 1941, alleging that he had suffered significant bodily injuries and mental anguish due to his work, which impaired his ability to earn a livelihood.",
