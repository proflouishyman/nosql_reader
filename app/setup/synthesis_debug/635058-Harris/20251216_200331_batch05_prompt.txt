Mr. Jean F. Smith,
Attorney and Counselor at Law,
Room 8-9, Miller Building,
423½ Ninth Street,
Huntington, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

I have noted your letter of April 11 concerning Mr. Charles Harris, known to us as Charley Harris, formerly employed as a fireman.

Under the Relief Department contract of membership, benefits are payable only during such period as a member in good standing is totally disabled by sickness or injury to perform any work. On the other hand, for employees in train and engine service, there is a certain physical standard that must be met if the employee is to remain in the service. A defect in an employee's physical condition, which would render him unsafe in train and engine service, need not be totally disabling.

When Mr. Harris was recalled to duty and underwent the necessary examination to determine his fitness for service, it was found that he was suffering from a condition which disqualified him under the physical standards s

SUMMARY:
A letter dated April 16, 1940, is sent to attorney Jean F. Smith regarding Mr. Charles Harris (Charley Harris), a former fireman. The letter discusses Harris's membership status and eligibility for benefits under the Relief Department contract. Harris was found physically unfit for his former position but not totally disabled, as he could potentially work other jobs. His membership was not revived since there is no record of payment for required contributions following his recall to duty.

Awaiting an early reply, I remain,

Yours very truly,

HCS:WLJ  April 11, 1940  MEMORANDUM  Charley Harris was employed as fireman, was furloughed March 22, 1937, and resumed duty on first call for services on October 10, 1939. He resumed duty within three years from the date of his original furlough, and regardless of physical condition, had he agreed to pay natural death contributions during the period he was out, he would have been eligible to automatic restoration to membership, but so far as I can determine, no one approached him on the subject of paying the natural death contributions, but instead, Form 60 was issued, and he was sent to the Medical Examiner for examination on October 7, 1939. Dr. Tinsley rejected him, as he was over age, and was suffering from an aortic systolic murmur, marking Form 60 “Rejected for membership,” but made no decision as to eligibility for employment, leaving that question for Dr. Millholland to decide.  Had Mr. Harris resumed duty on October 10, 1939, and not reported at all to the Medical Examiner, u

SUMMARY:
The memorandum discusses the employment and membership status of Charley Harris, a fireman who was furloughed and later resumed duty. Due to missed contributions and a subsequent medical rejection for membership (due to age and health), his eligibility for certain employee benefits and membership was negatively affected. The memo analyzes the implications of his handling by division officials and the potential consequences for benefit claims. Harris's application to the Railroad Retirement Board was denied due to insufficient service.

Dear Sir:
Referring to your letter to me dated March 20th, HCS-WJ-635058 in connection with my examination of Charles Harris, Fireman, Wheeling on October 7, 1939.
I have had a talk with the secretary to the Train Master located here and find that it was he who prepared Form 60 for Harris and on his Part 1 of the Form 60 is the notation “Last worked May 1937”. He states that most of those who were calling for Forms 60 for reemployment at that time were able only to approximate the time that they last worked, and it was his practice to enter on the Form 60 their statement and it then became my responsibility to question the employee to determine if he should be given reexamination, biennial, only for reemployment and if authorization for collection for a

Dr. Nimm:

I again have before me the case of Charley Harris, in connection with which I wrote you on March 15.

There is one feature of this case that I am particularly anxious to clear up. I presume the employing officers are familiar with the Operating Committee's decision that men restored to service after furlough within three years are eligible to restoration to membership, regardless of age or physical condition, provided they resume duty on after call, and have paid, or agree to pay, natural death contributions covering the period of temporary absence.

It is hard to understand why Mr. Harris was sent to you with a form 60, particularly as he is over the age limit to acquire membership. I wish you would talk to his immediate employing officer and determine whether or not Mr. Harris made any mention to him, when he was recalled to service, concerning his Relief Department membership, stating particularly whether he said that he did not want to pay up his natural

SUMMARY:
A letter dated March 20, 1940, from W. M. Kennedy addresses Dr. Nimm regarding Charley Harris's eligibility for restoration to membership after a furlough.

Dr. Nimai:

I have read your letter of October 25, 1939 to Dr. Milholland, in the case of Charley Harris, fireman, who was returning to duty after furlough of July 11, 1937, or within 5 years, in which I note your statement that he was over the age limit for new membership, and had been out of service too long for automatic restoration to membership.

As a matter of fact, if Mr. Harris was resuming duty on the first call within a period of 5 years from the date of his original furlough, he was eligible to automatic restoration to membership, regardless of age or physical condition. See in this connection circular letter No. 607 dated June 15, 1939.

Of course, if Mr. Harris' physical condition was such that he was unsafe in engine service, that was a matter for you to immediately report to Dr. Milholland for necessary action.

W. M. Kennedy


SUMMARY:
The document is a letter dated March 15, 1940, addressing a case regarding Charley Harris, a fireman returning to duty after being on furlough. The letter clarifies the rules for automatic restoration to membership for returning employees, stating that Harris was eligible for automatic restoration if resuming duty within five years, regardless of age or physical condition. However, if Harris was unfit for service, it should be reported for further action.

Mr. Charley Harris,
811 Hill Street,
Ceredo, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

Your letter of February 19, addressed to Dr. Milholland, has been referred to me, in which you advise that Dr. Stott has informed you that any medical assistance given you will be upon your responsibility, and ask whether it is this Department's intention to provide such treatment as may be required.

Even in instances of employees who are members of the Relief Department in good standing, there is no provision in the Relief Department regulations under which the Department assumes any responsibility whatever for the payment of any physicians or other charges that might accrue in connection with a sickness disability occurring to the member. Provision is made only for the furnishing of surgical care in the event a member is injured while in the discharge of his duty for the Company. Your disability is purely one of sickness, and in such a case, the responsibility for medical attention would

SUMMARY:
This document is a letter dated March 14, 1940, responding to Mr. Charley Harris's inquiry regarding responsibility for medical assistance. It clarifies that the Relief Department does not cover medical assistance for sickness—only surgical care for injuries incurred during work.

Dr. Roscoe Stotts,
Kenova,
W. Va.

Dear Doctor:

Mr. Charley Harris, Fireman Wheeling Division, who was rejected for employment on October 7th, 1939, upon return from furlough because of the existence of an aortic systolic murmur, has requested some information regarding his physical condition and mentions the fact that you are located close to his home in Kenova, and I assume that he intends to consult you.

After his rejection for employment he was further examined in Baltimore by our Diagnostic Unit in the University Hospital and his general physical condition was found to be satisfactory with the exception of a chronic valvular myocarditis and an aortic stenosis. You, of course, appreciate the fact that this particular type of valvular disease is quite a serious one, and there is a possibility of his sudden and for that reason we can not consistently consider him safe in engine service.

Very truly yours,

Medical & Surgical Director.
