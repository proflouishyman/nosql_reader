  "biographical_narrative": "Charles Harris, known as Charley Harris, was a fireman for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. He began his career and worked until he was furloughed on March 22, 1937. Harris resumed duty on October 10, 1939, after being recalled to service, but due to health issues, including an aortic systolic murmur and age-related concerns, he was medically rejected for continued employment in engine service by Dr. Tinsley on October 7, 1939. He worked until November 9, 1939, when he was officially taken out of service due to his medical condition. Harris sought financial assistance or an annuity from the railroad company and the Railroad Retirement Board but faced challenges due to insufficient service for eligibility.",
