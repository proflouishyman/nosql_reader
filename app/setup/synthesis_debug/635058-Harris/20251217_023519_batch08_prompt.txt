Charley Harris
May 31st, 1941.
Dr. O. Carroll Lockard,
2925 N. Charles Street,
Baltimore, Md.
Dear Doctor:-
The case of Charley Harris against the Baltimore and Ohio, which was recently set for trial at Huntington, W. Va., and continued, has been set for trial at Huntington, on June 6th. Our General Claim Agent has requested your presence and has suggested that you take with you the x-rays which were made in this case, or at least a copy of the findings of Dr. Walton. He feels that you could testify that in the course of the general examination x-rays were requested, and were returned with a negative interpretation and that you personally examined the x-rays and agreed with the interpretation, assuming that that is your opinion.
I presume you will arrange to go on the Chesapeake and Ohio, which will arrive at Huntington about 11 A. M.
Very truly yours,
Medical & Surgical Director.

Dr. E. V. Milholland, Medical & Surgical Director, Baltimore, Maryland.
Dear Doctor:
The above case, which recently was set for trial and continued, has again been set for trial at Huntington, W. Va., on June 6th, 1941.
We will again need Dr. H. W. Nimal, Medical Examiner, Parkersburg, and Dr. Carroll Lockard.
Dr. Lockard should take with him the X-rays which were made in this case and, at least, a copy of the findings of Dr. Walton. It seems unnecessary to send both Dr. Walton and Dr. Lockard, in view of the negative report on the X-rays. Certainly, Dr. Lockard can testify that, in the course of the general examination, X-rays were requested and were returned with a negative interpretation; that he personally examined the X-rays and agrees with that interpretation, - assuming that is his opinion.
Dr. Lockard can go on the C. & O., which arrives at Huntington about 11 a.m.; o
