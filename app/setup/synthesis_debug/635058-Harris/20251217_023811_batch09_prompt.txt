January 15, 1941
Mr. Connor Hall,
Attorney at Law,
202 First Huntington Arcade,
Huntington, W. Va.
Dear Sir:
In answer to yours of January 6, this is to advise that Mr. Charley Harris paid nothing to this Department as contributions after the month of March, 1937. While he had been a member of the Department prior to that date, and had paid the contribution required under his contract of membership, during the period for which the payment was made, the Department assumed liability for any benefits that may have become due. However, he has held no membership of any character since he was furloughed in March, 1937.
Respectfully,

SUMMARY:
This document is a letter dated January 15, 1941, to Mr. Connor Hall (Attorney at Law) regarding Charley Harris. It states that Charley Harris made no contributions to the Department after March 1937 and that he has not been a member since being furloughed in that month.

CONNOR HALL ATTORNEY AND COUNSELLOR AT LAW 202 FIRST HUNTINGTON ARCADE HUNTINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA January 6, 1941. Mr. W. L. Kennedy, Supt., B. & O. Railroad Co., Baltimore, Md., Dear Sir: I am in receipt of yours of January 3d and thank you for the information. Of course, if Mr. Harris did not pay the premiums he has no claim. So far I have not been able to ascertain the facts with reference to this. He advises me that no receipts are given except in case where money is lent for the purchase of homes. He seems to be under the impression that premiums on at least $500.00 were withheld from his pay during the period between his return to service and his discharge. Probably there is some way in which this could be definitely determined to the satisfaction of Mr. Harris. Yours very truly, [signature]

SUMMARY:
A letter dated January 6, 1941, from attorney Connor Hall to Mr. W. L. Kennedy regarding Mr. Harris's claim for withheld premium payments. The attorney thanks Mr. Kennedy for the information, explains that no receipts are given except for home purchase loans, notes Harris believes $500 in premiums were withheld, and seeks a way to resolve the concern.

HC:WLJ - 65505
January 3, 1941

Mr. Connor Hall,
Attorney at Law,
208 First Huntington Arcade,
Huntington, W. Va.

Dear Sir:

I have noted your letter of December 11, 1940 concerning the case of Charley Harris, but I do not have a clear understanding of the basis for any claim Mr. Harris seems to feel he has against this Department. He was furloughed from the service of this Company on March 22, 1937, and was recalled to duty on October 10, 1939. He made no effort to protect his membership in the Department after his furlough, and when he resumed duty, it was possible for him to renew the membership that had been in effect when the furlough began, provided, at that time, he had authorized collections from his earnings for natural death contributions to cover the period of his absence from service, but instead of agreeing to the payment of these arrears, he went before the Medical Examiner for the purpose of acquiring new membership on October 7, 1939, and was rejected. He was subsequen
... [truncated for length]

SUMMARY:
This letter, dated January 3, 1941, addresses a request from attorney Connor Hall regarding the case of Charley Harris and his claim against a department, presumably related to employment and benefits. The author explains that Harris was furloughed from his position in 1937 and recalled in 1939 but failed to maintain or renew his membership for benefit contributions during his absence. When attempting to re-acquire membership, Harris was rejected due to not meeting medical and occupational standards. The letter concludes that Harris holds no valid claim, as he has not been a member since 1937.
