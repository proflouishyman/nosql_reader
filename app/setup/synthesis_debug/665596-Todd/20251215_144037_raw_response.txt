He worked as a laborer in the Motive Power Department of the Cincinnati Terminal Division, indicating his role involved physical work around trains and railway equipment. By May 8, 1923, Todd had successfully completed an application process that required parental consent, suggesting he was still relatively young at the time. His career with B&O appears to have been stable without any noted injuries or disputes in the records provided.",
