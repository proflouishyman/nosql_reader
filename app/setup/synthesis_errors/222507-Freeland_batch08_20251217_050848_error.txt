  "biographical_narrative": "Thomas B. Freeland was a car repairman for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, based in Wiley Ford, West Virginia. His career with the railroad spanned several decades, during which he experienced multiple injuries that required medical attention and disability leave. In June 1942, while working at Cumberland Yards, he sustained a laceration on his right side of the face when a jack slipped from under a truck frame. This injury was treated promptly with sutures and tetanus antitoxin but did not result in any lost work time. Later that year, Freeland suffered an inguinal hernia while working at Cumberland Yards, which required surgical intervention on December 3, 1946, leading to a disability leave of eight weeks.",
