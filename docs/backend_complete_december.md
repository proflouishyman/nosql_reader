# Backend Architecture Note (Superseded)

This file was a December 2024 architecture snapshot and no longer reflects the current codebase.

Use this instead:

- `docs/february_how_this_works.md`

That February 2026 document is the maintained, code-accurate reference for:

1. Runtime architecture and startup flow.
2. API contracts and standard data formats.
3. Search/document/network viewer context mechanics.
4. Network edge build pipeline and query semantics.
5. Network statistics backend/frontend behavior.
6. Caching, failure modes, and extension points.
