## Archive Overview
Here are the archive orientation notes:

Scope and Coverage
The archival corpus covers a period of 109 years (1850-1959), with a total of 2931 documents processed. The records primarily focus on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, its Relief Department, and employee-related matters.

Voices represented and missing
The voices of employees in various departments are represented, particularly those in Maintenance of Way who reported eye injuries. However, the perspectives of management or executives are not as prominently featured, nor is there significant representation from external stakeholders such as local communities or government agencies.

Biases and selection effects
The records may reflect a bias towards documenting employee-related issues rather than broader company operations or financial matters. Additionally, the consistent use of passive voice in medical examiner reports could indicate an attempt to avoid attributing fault to the company.

Contradictions/surprises in the records
There are no explicit contradictions within the corpus; however, some patterns and trends suggest potential areas for further investigation (e.g., longer processing times for disability claims from the Cumberland Division).

Research potential and limitations
The archival corpus offers opportunities for research on labor relations, workplace safety, and employee welfare during a significant period in American industrial history. However, its limitations include a lack of external perspectives and potential biases towards documenting specific types of issues, which may impact the validity or generalizability of findings.
